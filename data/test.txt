Video, images & text are razor sharp. easy to read an ebook on its large screen. Get a case ASAP to protect that gorgeous glass! Fast processor, microSD slot, very friendly user interface. Extremely customizable: you can adjust almost ever possible feature on the phone! Dual screen mode is a plus!\n\nSome features are impractical in the real world and do work...kind of. Yes. You can scroll the screen just by moving your eyes...but only with some programs and your eyes have to be in the right position. Yes. Hand gestures work without touching the phone but, unless your hands are really dirty, you might as well, you know, touch it!. So, for bragging rights its impressive.\n\nI wish they hadn't changed the camera software available in the S3 which was more user adjustable and yielded rich, crisp images. If you want the camera to think for you, you may be happy. If you want to adjust ISO, white balance, anti-shake, yourself you're out of luck. These are often crippled in the available preset shooting \"Modes\". By the way, the 13 MP isn't available in every mode either! The lens is recessed and protected by glass which could get scratched easily. Video is excellent and playback will leave you breathless! Nevertheless, pictures look good but the S3 images win here by a nose.\n\nBattery life is impressive with 3 days of moderate use typical. Heavy users can get 2 days maybe. Calls are crisp & clear. Sound quality is outstanding. So, a few personal annoyances aside, its a great phone that works well in spite of all its gimmickry. Well done, Samsung.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: screen size\n\nCons: volume for everything. music. phone talk.\n\nPhone is awsome except for a few key factors......the speaker phone is so quiet and terrible. The in call volume is low. And the music volume through the speakers is bad. And also and case that is made big to protect it. Makes it extremely hard to press the button on the bottom right and left and even the button in the midddle, the main one. But other than that the phone is awsome. Great Camera and great HD screen. Can watch HD movies and record HD video. Phone is extremely fast and has great turn by turn navigation. You can play many games and get apps to manage any sort of financial account. The battery lasts long enough for a whole day of full use. (Doesn't compare to droit razr hd Maxx. But this phone can do more than any other I have ever had. Overall I would rate this phone highly and I would recommend it to anyone.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Great picture clarity and quality\n\nCons: The price, the position of the power button, the fragile screen.\n\nI must say that as an entertainment device, the Galaxy 4S is incredible. I upgraded from an IPhone 4 and also have an iPhone 5 for a work phone, so I can make several direct comparisons. First of all, the Galaxy screen is much larger and more vivid appearing than the iPhone indoors. The sound quality is good, but volume control can leave a bit to be desired. The controls and features on the Galaxy are all incredible, including voice recognition, talk to text, and similar features all work seamlessly. I find myself repeating less often on the Galaxy with Google than on the iPhone with Siri. My largest complaints with the Galaxy are all hardware related. I never drop the phone and yet the screen cracked completely across the middle after only two months of usage. Also, the power button seems inconveniently large and positioned on the outside of the phone, causing multiple erroneous shutdowns. And finally, while the Galaxy gives a wide range of screen brightness options, I find the iPhone to be easily read both indoors and out at the same setting. My Galaxy however, needs to be set to an extremely high brightness to be even somewhat visible outdoors, and with that same setting is nearly blinding inside.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: It's easy to use and customize\n\nCons: It can be combersome due to the large screen\n\nOverall this is an outstanding phone. I've owned it just over a month. It does what it's supposed to and no serious complaints. The sound quality is great for calls, and it works in stores that my old phone wouldn't due to signal strength. My old phone was an HTC Incredible 2 and was only 3G so I don't know if the difference is primarily because this phone is 4G. But it works great. I like the camera quality images, and large screen of this phone. However if your hands are small, you should think carefully. It can be cumbersome, but isn't bad after some getting used to. I am disappointed with the size and legibility of the keyboard secondary functions and often have to page to the symbols because I can't tell what they are. My vision is very good with glasses, but it still gives me trouble. They could have done a better job with the keyboard given the size of the screen. And it's not much better in landscape mode. I do like the number keys above though. That makes up for paging to the symbols. If I didn't get this I'd take a close look at the HTC One. I do miss having an FM tuner in my phone. This one doesn't feature that and my old HTC Incredible 2 did. The television remote feature does work very well though, so again it's a trade off. Overall I'm very pleased and Best Buy was great.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Excellent display quality with good enough battery life. Got it on sale,so price was excellent for the features.\n\nCons: Large size is a little cumbersome. Difficult to sync with PC productivity apps - e.g. Outlook.\n\nThis is my first real smartphone - had a Blackberry, so I am still learning how best to use it. The display and sound quality are great and the 4G connection is much faster. Easy to set up the basics, including email connection. Still trying to find apps that are best for work productivity and also for music. It is the good and bad of having so many app choices- it takes too long to find what works best.\nOverall, I'm happy with the purchase.", "Pros: Light weight, battery lasts all day, UI is smooth and quick\n\nVery pleased with the S4. Miles ahead of the older Samsung phones. Device is light-weight. UI is smooth and responsive. The screen is big, images are clear and easy to see. Camera is excellent. - pictures are sharp, colors are vibrant. Voice recognition is very good (better with Google Search than S Voice). Very pleased with the battery life. Was all ready to buy an extended battery - not needed with this phone. With proper management of mobile data usage, the phone lasts all day and then some (and I use it for work email). Very happy with this phone...", "Pros: Ease of use, size, functionality\n\nCons: nothing\n\nAfter getting my new S4 and setting it up the way I wanted it, very easy I might add. The phone is great. does more than I could ever need. The clarity in the screen, pictures and sound is amazing. The battery life is insane w/out the internet on and even w it on the battery still will go for 12hrs plus depending the amount of internet use. Either way it blows away the i5 battery.", "Pros: Large but pocketable, lightweight, tons of good accessories, replaceable battery\n\nCons: Gee-whiz features not mature yet, don't work well (air control, etc)\n\nThis phone has an incredible camera! The picture quality is superb.\n\nI picked this unit over the LG G2, and the HTC One. SD card expansion and removable battery sold it for me. It's display is beautiful. The sound is loud and has good quality (for a cell phone). Not crazy good like the HTC One, but good.\n\nThe wi-fi reception is 5/5 and the cell reception is almost as good. The battery life is mostly acceptable, but I'm considering an extended battery.\n\nI don't like the following:\n* Too many indicators and things in the notification area.\n* Too many dialogs to have to answer\n* Touchwiz is not standard Android and has some funny procedures.\n\nEnhance this phone with the following:\n* $29 dock gives you an attractive alarm clock with weather, while charging.\n* Turn most of the whiz-bang features off, they don't work right anyway.\n* Root and install Xposed Framework and Wanam Xposed. Those two allow you to safely tweak a few things that will polish the rough edges on this handset.\n* Replace the stock launcher with Nova Launcher. It's super fast and you get to keep most of the Touchwiz stuff you like.\n\u00ab collapse", "Talk to anyone who loves Android, and the company that's become the face of the Android smartphone platform isn't Google, it's Samsung.

So far my pictures have turned out crisp and clear and I\u2019ve had no problem with color. It\u2019s important to use the right settings before you shoot a picture (i.e. a picture of a sunset will not turn out as well if the camera is set to Sports mode). I\u2019m always amazed when people complain about their \u201cPhone\u201d camera \u2013 it\u2019s a PHONE . . . . . if you want to take great pictures, get yourself a good camera.\n\nFinally, Samsung does frequent updates, which hopefully means they\u2019re working out the bugs, listening to their customers and will continue to support the phone even though they\u2019re getting ready to launch a newer version.\n\nCons\nRequires Root to get rid of Bloatware: Too many apps which you can\u2019t delete and probably won\u2019t really use, and you can't store apps on the SD card.

But I want to share 2 big issues I have with this phone.\n1. They haven't fixed a common wifi bug where at times when connected for a long period (daily at home) and try and use your phone the internet will no longer work - it will say its connected but websites/internet apps will just hang forever until you disable wifi and switch to 4G data.. then bam! things work. Resetting the wifi has become a daily hassle... and also I'm missing what are sometimes important notifications because I could go hours without working internet not knowing since it says its connected. This issue I thought was my routers fault, but even after switching it out 2x over the past few months and knowing this SAME ISSUE happens with my wife's GSIII, I have narrowed it down to phone. I have used the Linksys E4200 router as well as netgear R6300 and the new netgear nighthawk which the issue appeared on within a couple hours. Google this issue \"Galaxy wifi connected but no internet\" thousands of forum posts with no fixes... Samsung acknowledges the issue and has for more than a year but offers no solution or bug fix yet.\n\n2. Since the time of the Galaxy SIII these phones have been known to crack very easy with small drops. Well.. I never once dropped my previous Moto Atrix 4G, however, within 2 months of owning this phone it has 3x slipped out of my pocket while sitting and fallen to the floor.. and yup.. from 2' the screen is now cracked.. I will be using my accidental warranty eventually if the single hairline crack gets any worse. I'm confident that MOST other smartphones on the market could handle the fall it took. And this phone certainly is far more slippery with its glossy plastic finish than most. Its just very frustrating that in order for the phone to not break itself in my pocket i have to buy a bulky case with some grip.\n\n3. The smaller issue is with the software on the phone... this is a popular, new, near top of the l ...\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Most advanced features of any Android\n\nCons: Battery life is decent, good to have a spare\n\nWhen you have a good thing going, why not start with that as your baseline. Samsung has done just that with the S4. The S3 and the S4 are very similar on many levels and very different in key areas. Their size is essentially the same at 5.38\" x 2.75\" x .31\". This actually makes the S4 .7mm thinner than the S3. Its weight is 4.6 ounces, .7 ounces lighter than the S3. Comparing the two, Samsung has increased the size of the screen to a 5\" display that offers full HD resolution at 1920 x 1080 pixels. While other phones offer similar resolutions, none have the same quality image that comes from the Super AMOLED screen offered on the S4. Side-by-side comparisons with phones such as the HTC One find the S4 shines with more prominent resolution and richer color tones.\n\nThe screen also has improved capacitance over the S3 and previous Samsung offerings. This improved capacitance supports phone use while gloves are worn. Those who live in cold climates or those who are fashion conscious and wear gloves will find this enhanced capability helpful. While this capability is a nice addition, it takes some getting used to. Because it is more sensitive, it's easy to falsely register a finger press if you hover your hand over the screen in the just the right way. Hopefully Samsung can correct this performance flaw with future software upgrades.\n\nThe S4 houses a whopping 13-megapixel, rear-facing camera and a 2-megapixel, front facing camera. The rear-facing, 13-megapixel camera image is excellent. The imaging capabilities of both cameras extend past the raw hardware with added features built into their associated software. There is software to do most anything you can think of with the images taken. Software even uses both the front and back camera to offer all kinds of imaging effects from panoramic images to slow motion videos.\n\nSamsung has integrated a 1.9GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 processor to help keep things purring along smoothly. At the time of this review, this m ...\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Features, screen size and resolution\n\nCons: Battery could last longer\n\nI did not expect that much of an improvement over the S3 but wow! Tis is an exceptional device. And very fast on VZW 4G. So many great features, many useful, will take time to figure them all out. Very impressed by HD video and photo quality. Really like the large screen with amazing clarity. I do wish the battery lasted a little longer, but that could be software related.", "Pros: The best pictures in a phone.\n\nCons: There is some bug with it.\n\nThis is a great phone, don't get me wrong. It takes vivid and great pictures. The options for the camera are great and it takes great videos. There are many things this phone can do, but are we really going to use all of them? Some of the bugs are: it gets stock in some screens, for example, the texting screen gets stock on a tilted screen and when I try to tilted the screen, it wont move so I have to close the texting screen and reopen it. It will be easier if the keyboard has have to comma in the first screen and not make it look for it on a second screen. I notice with this phone that here in Orlando, FL I don't have 4G speed but my family does in Michigan. The volume in the incoming/outgoing calls is always low and I always have to turn it up. One thing that bugs me is that when I'm online or on facebook, I cannot touch a picture and save it to the phone, it does not allow me to do that, why? When on Driving Mode, it takes to long to recognize my commands. Other then that, I love the size, the feel of it, the touch screen, the picture, the different screen. Yes, I do like it more then my last phone which was an HTC Evo, but like I say, there is room for improvement.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Great picture quality, perfect size, easy to use\n\nCons: How icons are set up. I am not sure how to use all the features yet\n\nI thought I would have trouble switching from my IPhone 4, but the transition has been easy. I haven't missed my IPhone at all. The picture quality is clearer. The screen is bigger & has a better quality to it. I love the fact that you can make any of the songs in your play list a ring tone. Downloading your music is easy as well. I love this phone and recommend it for every one.", "Pros: Battery life and large screen\n\nCons: Has issues with reloading deleted emails.\n\nOver all this phone is not bad. I am pleased with the size of the screen, I wanted a larger phone to make texting easier for my large fingers. Sync with other Samsung device is cool. It does have an issue with reloading deleted emails which is a bit of a pain to deal with on a regular basis. I wish sound was a bit better, I have an Otter Box case on it so that might be part of it.", "Pros: Screen size, Picture Quality, Responsive.\n\nCons: Don't know yet. Durability is my main concern.\n\nAmazed at what it can do. Still need time to fully absorb all the features. However, unless you live in a fantasy world, most of us drop our phones on concrete and/or expose them to heat and moisture eventually. Hopefully the plastic construction is meant to deter those effects better than metal. (Plastic is not a bad thing.) I believe every phone should have hand-to-concrete 9 lives drops. We'll just have to wait and see how this one holds up. Yes, I have a Superman proof case. But we shouldn't need one.", "Pros: Sized right, good price (free)\n\nCons: Battery lasts all day but needs to last longer\n\nBeautiful design, just the right size and great features. Incredible screen resolution and touch. Nice UI works great and runs fast and smooth. Plenty of apps via Google play and Samsung.", "Pros: Memory, speed, size, picture/video quality\n\nCons: Battery life is horrible\n\nThis is the best phone I have had. Best Buy offers a much better price than my provider T-Mobile. (Do not purchase from T Mobile and pay $24/month for 2 years.) I no longer have to worry about running out of space for apps and pictures. Anytime I have let a friend see a video, they always comment on how big the screen is and how clear the picture is. However, the battery life is not that great, so bring a charger with you.", "I've had multiple Android phones, got an iPhone 5 a few months ago and abdolutely loved it. Decided to try out the Galaxy S4 because of the camera and features. I was highly disapoointed!! The Samsung sales guy showed me features of this phone but if course the display models are made to amplify the quality of the features of the phone. Admittedly, I was duped. You better have a completely steady hand to take pictures that are anywhere near the quality of the photos on the display models, and I mean not even blinking movement. My iPhone 5 camera wasn't like that and the clarity and vibrance of the photos were so much better. If you have small hands and need to use one hand to text or do ANYTHING with this phone, be prepared to hit the \"back\" button ALOT because the palm of your hamd will constantly be hitting buttons you don't want. Having the numbers integrated on the keyboard is nice, but otherwise you'll be battling with this thing all the time. Videos take forever to load and play (and its not my internet, they worked fine on my iphone). The \"wave to scroll\", \"airview\" and video pausing when you look away features are all kind of superficial and work only when they want to. Less than 24 hours after getting this phone from Best Buy, the screen wouldn't come on. I could hear text messages coming through, and the menu buttins were lighting up but the screen was doing absolutely nothing. Not a great first impression. Best Buy was wonderful about exchanging it for me, so kudos to them. This phone is going back today and I'm getting an iPhone 5 again. The battery life on this thing is absolutely ridiculous... I can't even get half a day out of this thing. Just not worth it. So bummed.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Speed, Call Quality, Display, Battery Life, Camera\n\nCons: Bloatware (but most can be disabled)\n\nOverall this phone is great.\n\nI love the fact that I can have many apps open and it still runs smooth.\n\nI love the fact that I don't have to root the phone to disable applications that I don't use (most of the stock apps). The camera is the best smart phone camera that I've had (against the D3, DX2, HTC Eris).\n\nThe battery life, even with the extra power and display size is great, I get better battery life from this phone than I did in any previous phone.\n\nThe call quality is great, much clearer with the phone itself and the over the Bluetooth.\n\nI can easily watch youtube videos over the 4g connection without delay.\n\nNit picky stuff:\n- VZW and/or Samsung thank you for putting the Wifi Toggle on with the rest of the toggles, but please remove the configure link in the notifications section. Alternatively, give us the option to remove it like the display brightness.\n- The Bluetooth toggle does not need to open up a dialog window everytime you turn it on.\n- Touchwiz does not need to have the screen indicator take up so much space or directly above the dock icons. I feel there could be more room for icons on the screen if the reduced the spacing and moved the screen indicator.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Great screen, decent camera\n\nCons: Poor battery life, very weak antenna, most of the gestures don't work (smart scroll, wave to answer, etc.), runs hot.\n\nThis phone just isn't worth the hype or the $750 pricetag (which btw is $100 more at BestBuy than the $650 Verizon charges for the phone). It has an excellent screen and a decent camera (panorama mode works wonderfully!) but that's about all it's got going for it. You can't move apps to the SD card, so the tiny 16GB internal memory gets chewed up fast. The antenna is absolutely HORRIBLE, and places I was getting full bars of 4G on my old HTC Thunderbolt, I'm getting maybe 2 bars on the S4, if I'm lucky. The phone also runs incredibly hot out of nowhere sometimes. All of a sudden I'll be at work and the phone will start burning a hole in my pocket. The TouchWiz touch interface has crashed a number of times, leaving no other remedy but a battery pull. The audio is weak and tinny and directs the sound away from your face, leaving you to cup your hand in front of the speaker to direct the sound back towards your ears. On top of that, it has pretty weak battery life and most of the gestures they feature in the ads do not work properly, if at all. Wave hand over screen to answer the telephone works maybe 1 in 10 times. Look away to pause video and smart scroll (which is supposed to track eye movements) have never worked, not a single time! Basically all of the groundbreaking features they prominently bill to sell the S4 don't really work and you are left with a nice looking and feeling piece of plastic in your hand that doesn't do anything better (and most of the time does things worse) than your old phone. If you prefer form over function, this is the phone for you. On a rare positive note, Samsung's S-Voice is a Siri-killer. It has better voice recognition than Apple's Siri and can carry out a broader range of tasks than Siri does, and it can do it pretty much flawlessly unlike Siri.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: battery, size, durable, features\n\nCons: would like front facing speakers\n\nEasily the best phone on the market right now. I love the expandable MicroSD card slot which no Apple products have. I initially thought it would be too large but it's so thin that it actually takes up less room in my pocket and I previously had the Droid Bionic and the phone fits in the armband and bike cases I used for the Bionic. It's super fast, great battery life. The iPhone looks so old compared to the interface of the Android. I love the multitasking and dual screen features as well as the gestures. The only complaint would be is I wish it had stereo front facing speakers like the HTC One but the speakers are still very good for the size of the device.", "Pros: size, storage, removable battery, Samsung ecosystem\n\nCons: laggy software\n\nThere are tons of online reviews that go into great depth, so I will be short.\n\nHardware: amazing, period. micro SD card slot, removable battery, loud speakers, nice screen(indoors), Samsung ecosystem, great camera\n\nSoftware: the added Samsung software is actually nice. Some of the features sound gimmicky, and all features are not for everyone, but overall they are very nice and I found quite a few to be very useful. All of that being said, as it sits now with the currently released software for the AT&T model, the overall feel is very sluggish, laggy, and glitchy. A little disclaimer, I use my phone all day long, so I am not the normal user. If you only use it a few minutes and notice one second of lag, no biggie. But I use it for hours on end for work, so when it delays and lags going into and out of apps, it becomes frustrating. All of this will be fixed with future software updates, it is already resolved on the newly released S4 Active, but for now the lag remains.\n\nPro and con: screen. Screen is amazing indoors, but not as bright outdoors in direct sunlight. If you use it outside a lot or just work outside, something to consider. S4 Active uses a different type of screen so it is much better outdoors.\n\nOverall a very nice phone, will be much better with some future software updates.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: customizable, size, picture, widgets, watching videos\n\nCons: hard to see in sunlight, lack of some apps\n\nI switched from iPhone and I love this phone! There are some things I miss about my iPhone, mainly apps I had that aren't yet available for android. I've been back and forth with iPhone 4, then Galaxy S2, then iPhone 5 and now back to the S4. I love the screen on the S4! It's beautiful and so great for watching sports and videos. It's hard to see in the sunlight, even on full brightness. It's frustrating because most of the time I try to keep it low, so when if I don't adjust it before I got out into the sunlight then I'm stuck because I can't even see on the screen to make it brighter.\n\nThe camera is lovely for most pictures. I have 2 small black dogs and I definitely do not get pictures of as good quality as I did on my iPhone 5. I haven't really tried any of the other features.\n\nI haven't been able to get the eye scrolling or anything to work, but I haven't really tried. The ability to waive my hand over to see a preview of what's happening is awesome! Also the hovering to see a preview of pictures in albums and text messages, etc.\n\nI love widgets! They\u2019re great to preview sports scores, weather, calendar, facebook, etc.\n\nThe battery life is actually really good! One of the main reasons I switched back to iPhone after having a S2 is because of battery life. I can get all day use out of my S4 and still not be in battery panic territory (hmm, I\u2019d probably call this 30%). I used it as a GPS and other researching while on vacation in San Francisco and was able to use it constantly from about 8 in the morning until 3 or 4.

All you need to do is talk to Galaxy and it will do the rest for you.\n\nCons: 1) The volume setting sucks, when you plug in a headphone jack, the volume defaults to the middle automatically, I've look on all volume setting and maxed it out, but for every time you play music, it goes to the middle again. This goes the same for calls, you would need to constantly adjust the volume. 2) Unlike iPhone, camera can be used immediately from locked screen, with Galaxy, you would need to unlock it first.\n\nOverall: I like the screen size, widget and the driving mode functions only if iOS would offer those 3, I'd go back to iPhone. But for now, I'm loving the phone. Image so perfect, you may not need your glasses..lol\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Easy to use. Very user friendly\n\nCons: Haven't figured out how to make my playlists music my ringtones.\n\nPurchased the Samsung Galaxy 4s as my first smartphone. Liked the compactness of the phone. The screen colors are very sharp. Battery life is very good. Purchased the III for my husband. His first smartphone. He really likes the touchscreen and the fact that you can change the size of the letters. Have owned Samsungs for several years and have always been very satisfied them their products.", "Pros: Easy set up, great price, great camera, great size\n\nMy wife just got this phone to upgrade from her original Droid Incredible. This was a huge upgrade for her. She now has 4G which is blazing fast compared to her previous 3G speeds. The phone's camera is incredible. It's very fast to take the picture, the is very little shutter lag, and the picture quality is great at 13MP. The phone is very fast and responsive to input. About the only thing that could be made better on it is the location of the rear speaker. The sound quality is good however, even at maximum volume. I highly recommend this phone. Plus, Verizon wanted $99.99 for the phone (for a long time customer), BBY had it on sale for $49.99, plus we get $100.00 in bill credits with Verizon. Therefore, we essentially got paid $50.00 to buy the phone through BBY!\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Size, Screen quality, System, Camera, Battery life\n\nSwitched mine and my wife's from T-mobile S2 to Verizon S4. Free was a great price! The girl took care of all the setup and porting our numbers. Android system is very similar to what I had on my S2 so easy transition. Screen/picture quality is awesome! Love the phones.", "Pros: Camera,voice to text\n\nCons: Batt life could be a little longer. Hard to set ringer volume. It's either to soft or easily set too loud.\n\nOverall good phone,lots of features I feel are still unknown to me. Some video tutorials showing some shortcuts/tricks would be nice.", "Pros: Price was great for the quality of phone and features.\n\nCons: very flat screen needs a cover with lip so it will not shatter if dropped.\n\nI have had many models of Samsung phones and I have been very happy with them. And the Samsung Galaxy 4 has not disappointed. The screen size is great, the camera takes quality pictures and has many modes of use. I have had the phone for 3 months and I am still learning some of the features. But I have had no problems and am very happy with it. Please note: This is not a phone for someone who is just starting to use an android. There are just to many features and could be confusing for a newbie. It is however a fantastic phone for the person who uses their android for business, personal and fun.", "Pros: Easy to use, great battery life, screen size\n\nCons: nothing!\n\nI switched from an iPhone to the Samsung S4. I have been anti-i anything my entire life, so I was looking forward to the switch. My husband got this phone about 2 months before me and I was so jealous waiting for my upgrade to come. The screen at first feels like it's enormous, but once you use it for a few minutes, it's amazing. The clarity is great, the call volume is great, easy to download apps, super fast processor. Camera is great. Absolutely love this phone! If you're thinking of making the switch, DO IT!!! You won't regret it!", "Pros: Easy to set up and navigate\n\nCons: Battery life not as good as advertised\n\nThis has been a very good upgrade from my BlackBerry Style. Much bigger screen and much easier to read. Great pics and videos as well. Very fast and smooth operation.", "Pros: Size, screen\n\nCons: Battery life, software, build quality\n\nI have been an android user for the past 6 years and this phone made me switch to the iPhone. The build of this phone is okay at best. The plastic creaks, the hyperglaze on the plastic easily picks up fingerprints and scuffs, and the bezel around the outside chips with the slightest of touches. Some people love it while some hate it. I was neutral about it so I decided to get this phone. The main part of this phone that I enjoyed was the screen. This AMOLED 1080p can get very bright and very crisp. Lets just say that it is a pleasure to watch or read something on this screen.\n\nUnfortunately, that's about where my good experiences end. I think that touchwiz ruins this phone. The software doesn't lag, only if ...\n\n\nexpand \u00bb", "Pros: Tons of apps, large and crystal clear screen\n\nCons: Battery life\n\nOne of my kids went with the iPhone 5, the other went with the Galaxy 4. After a month, I talked to both of them and my daughter was more impressed with her Galaxy, so I bought one for myself. Everything about it is sweet - big screen, super clear, good sound, good camera. My only two complaints are:\n1) The camera has a tendency to blur and I haven't been able to figure out if Steady Shot works on the camera or just the video recorder, so I have to been super careful to hold it steady.\n2) The bigger issue is the battery life. If I'm using apps, nav, texting, and talking on the phone, etc., it will go from 100% to dead in 12 hours. My barf-tastic Blackberry lasted way longer than this. The Galaxy screen is large and washes out in sunlight, so you need to keep the brightness up (yes, I'm sure that's part of the battery problem). Overall though, I'm very happy with it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a lower cost alternative to an iPhone.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Sound and picture quality\n\nCons: Battery life needs to be managed\n\nSound, picture and video quality is excellent. Full range of features. Battery life needs to be managed by limiting some features to extend time between charging. Overall an excellent phone.", "Pros: Downloads are easy, no syncing with iTunes. Great picture quality, better than iPhone.\n\nPhone is easy to use. Battery life lasts longer than the iPhone. Storage capacity freedom, can add up to a total of 80gb. The screen has a better resolution when streaming videos and viewing pictures.", "Pros: Clarity, easy to see\n\nCons: Battery life is short\n\nThe picture quality is awesome. Swapped from Apple to Android so still getting used to how to use it. I like that I can look at two things at once. Speakers are good also. The battery drains easily. That is probably the only downside.", "Pros: Price, quality & features and good looks.\n\nCons: Nothing yet.\n\nPicked this up free on a Black Friday promotion. By far the best phone I've ever owned. It's really like have a mini laptop with you at all times. It can do it all and does it very well. Organizer, calendar, email, text, talk, videos, pictures all on a beautiful vivid display. I've added a 64GB SD chip and now I can use it without limitations for family videos and photos.", "Pros: sizze of screen, clarity of photos and email\n\nCons: I am hard of hearing, so the ability to increase the volume even more would be reall helpful..\n\nI Love the features,size of screen, clarity of photos and email, and ability to \"pinch\" to enlarge photos and text.", "Pros: camera, software, capibilities\n\nCons: questionable battery life (what smartphone doesn't)\n\nI love my Galaxy S4. It has truly been the greatest phone I have ever purchased. The camera is amazing, I have never taken better photos with a phone. The front facing camera is one of the best on the market. Software and app selection is amazing! Battery life can be questionable sometimes, but I go to school where signal varies and I don't switch to Airplane Mode, which can make a difference. Great customer service when I bought this as well. I also recommend Trident cases, great case system with the AMS Kraken cases. 3-1 case system, something that Otterbox nor Lifeproof can do!", "Pros: Size, features, sound\n\nCons: Battery, reception\n\nI went from an iPhone 4 to the Galaxy S4 because I wanted a larger screen, and I was told that this one was the best on the market. I really like the size of the screen and the picture quality on it. They are both great. This phone also has a ton of cool features with it.\n\nMy biggest issue is the battery life. IT IS SHORT. I charge this phone more than my 4yr old iPhone 4 that is still using its original 4yr old battery. I have read reviews of turning of settings to extend battery life so I have done that, I even went to the Samsung department in Best Buy and had them go trough the phone to have it run with the best battery life settings. Still less charge time than my iPhone. I am at the point that I have all the features off and I go in and manually turn them on to use them just so I have enough battery to get me though the day, It is a bit of a hassle. If the phone sets unused from a full charge at the end of the day I will have about 15% battery life left. UNUSED!\n\nThe folks at best buy said that my short battery life is due to the phone being used on the Sprint network. Even though it should last more than a day.\n\nMy second biggest grips is I own a Jawbone Bluetooth and it sounds very garbled on this phone sometimes to the point you can not make out what people are saying. I have no idea what is causing it or if there is a setting to fix it. but by default it sounds horrible.\n\nSo it is a good phone with tons of cool features, but if your going to purchase this phone get an extra or larger battery for it.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Speed of multitasking.\n\nCons: Short battery life.\n\nGreat phone.

The screen quality is terrific, keyboard for email, texting and internet works well and the camera takes high quality pictures. Streaming audio with Bluetooth in my car is another great feature that works easily. Keeping calendar and contacts synched with my laptop is a snap. Oh, it's also a good phone. I can't think of anything I don't like about Galaxy S4!", "Pros: multitasking capabilities and processing power\n\nCons: battery life can easily drain if you aren't careful\n\nEasily a great phone hands down. The only issues I have is with the battery and speakers. The battery life while good can easily die if you do not pay a lot of attention to what programs and notifications you have running in the background. Outside of that, the speaker design is not the best. The positioning of the speaker on the bottom back of the phone yields poor sound quality unless you place the screen face down. If you do that, it makes controlling your music difficult unless you have voice control set up.", "Pros: Screen resolution is fantastic\n\nCons: Plastic case\n\nVery impressed with this phone. Video is excellent. Voice quality is very good along and text messaging keyboard is good but wish the keys were slightly larger. Too new to really comment on battery life but so far no complaints.", "Pros: Easy to use\n\nCons: Battery life\n\nThe phone sounds good wifi is great and the size is perfect. The screen has good a good view when using it to look at the web and emails.", "Pros: So many great features that makes it a convenient phone and tablet at one time!\n\nCons: Using certain features a lot like the Air Gesture can run the battery down pretty FAST!\n\nI really love my phone and I am so glad I chose to invest in it! It is so worth it and I learn new things about it everyday! I love taking pictures with it and being able to capture both sides of images and videos at the same time as well! This phone is absolutely the best I've had so far in my life!\n\nOh, and the Otterbox case that I purchased from Bestbuy ($49.99) was price matched with the online Amazon price ($36) of the same case!\nSo I was given the difference as a refund!\nThanks Bestbuy for price matching!", "I love the screen size and the features of the S4. The technology is top notch. The android market has lots of good apps for simplifying daily tasks (but some of the big iPhone apps aren't on the android market - like Disney). The battery life is short, but can be adjusted with several settings. The camera tends to take blurry pictures and difficult to get settings perfect. The phone almost has TOO many features...figuring out how to set the phone up perfectly could take forever.

Was a bit hard to get used to the large size of the phone, but having the larger viewing screen definately makes up for any inconvenince in grasping it. Sometimes a bit hard to hear callers on the other end but overall sound and call quailty are excellent. The Camera takes excellent photos!

It has a big display (bigger then most phones) that will do your videos and pictures justice. I am not a huge picture taker, but the camera on this phone is really good and takes great photos. If you are clumsy, this might not be the phone for you because it is fairly fragile, but a good case can help rectify that. Great phone for the price....Samsung knows how to make a great product!", "Pros: Lots of features and easy to use\n\nCons: Battery is just OK.\n\nVery functional phone with strong capabilities.

Pictures and videos look great. The things that can be accomplished without touching the phone (Air Gestures) are really cool. The eye tracking used for scrolling through emails and such doesn't work consistently but it's cool when it does work. The phone is very thin but the battery suffers for it. I've already upgraded to a much bigger battery and get significantly more time between charges. The drawback is obviously a heavier, thicker phone. To me, it's worth it. The camera is very fast with very little lag time. One small but very helpful feature, is being able to hide the programs that I'll never use but can't be uninstalled because Verizon, in their infinite wisdom, thought they would try to cram some bloatware in there. Very nice feature to keep things looking tidy. Overall, I highly recommend this phone and very much enjoy making the Iphone aficionados in life more than a little jealous.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Fast, user friendly, awesome feature set\n\nCons: Battery not great with awesome features, speaker is on the back, camera is hit or miss\n\nI purchased the Motorola DROID when it first came out. I then picked up the DROID 3 a couple years later when my contract was up. I liked them for the physical keyboard, but they were always a bit lacking on the power side. Two years after that (now), there was no other DROID announced other than ones with no physical keyboard. So I decided it might be time to give up on the keyboard and go for the most advanced features out there. Enter the Galaxy S4.\n\nI looked up reviews, and most people seemed very happy with the performance and battery life of the S4 (although the battery life on the Galaxy Note 2 is better). I researched pros and cons of the S4 vs. the Note 2, and the S4 won mainly because I do not need a giant screen like the Note 2 has, and the S4 is a bit faster. I could not have been happier with my purchase.\n\nAlmost every day since I have gotten the phone, I have found new things I can do with the phone. I have it set up to control my television (it gives me a channel guide and even suggestions!), and it can change my channels and everything. The IR receiver is very handy to have.\n\nThe camera, while taking pictures at an astounding 14 megapixels, is hit or miss. I have gotten some excellent pictures from it, and I have gotten some awful pictures from it (especially in lower light situations). I never expect a phone's camera to be great though, so this doesn't bother me that much.\n\nThe gesture and Air Play features that you see on the commercials are all present, although leaving them on all the time drains the battery fairly quickly. I always have a charger with me no matter if I am at home or work, so again this is not a big deal for me. But it is something to think about.\n\nOverall, this phone is by far the most advanced phone I have ever owned.

When taking pictures, the quality is great! I can take wonderful shots automatically and there are many features for me to explore and get creative with my pictures. The screen is large enough to work great for video applications without wearing out my eyes. My email has worked fine for both gmail and other email sites. The sound quality is fine for phone calls, but I would like better quality for many apps, such as Pandora.", "Pros: Picture and camera quality are great.

Look it up online.\n\nI can have the phone in front of me, and it won't ring, even though a few seconds earlier the same person called and it rang. Someone will call and say they called me 7 times (which probably means 3# but it still means I missed calls. My sister and I where texting and she tried to call, kicked her straight into VM...no record of her call. Look online...this is not something you want to be stuck with if you can't afford to miss calls, family, work, clients etc. Hard to remember why I don't like the phone #so many strong features), just because you don't know someone called, they still did and somewhere down the line, it will bite you!", "Pros: The battery life is great.

So many bonuses to this phone and the sound quality on the calls is great. Battery life is pretty extensive for how much it does & how many programs it will open at one time. Eye movement detection is a little different to get use to at first, your screen will move before you are ready for it to. It really does pause videos when you look away from the screen.", "Pros: Good battery life, Awesome Pictures!\n\nCons: sound when watching videos could be better\n\nLove the phone! I don't have many complaints about it beside the video sound being hard to hear if there is other noise in the room.\n\nIt is super light and thin. Awesome software and features!

Camera quality is excellent. Construction is durable but I still purchased an Otter Box cover for further protection against potential mishaps. Connectivity with other devices (tablets, PC, Smart TV, car, etc) is very good. UI is fairly intuitive, with an \"Easy\" mode for the first-time user (larger icons and just the most-used apps).

I felt intimidated by smart phones even though I'm very tech-savvy.\n\nNow that I have the phone, I don't know what I would have done without it. I know I'm not using it to its full capacity but I love being able to read books on the Kindle app, and I like checking my step-count on the fitness app. I like the different scene set-ups for the camera and it's fantastic to have the internet so easily at-hand. It also helps me keep up with my email better and I'm appreciative that I can access wi-fi networks to reduce data charges. Actually, I'm surprised how little data it uses to read email and do the occasional web-browsing.\n\nWhen I'm at home or at work or in a store with wi-fi, I just connect to the available wi-fi network and then I can use my phone without concern about data charges. I don't do heavy data stuff like watching movies or anything like that.\n\nI got an Otterbox to protect the phone and I've written a review of the case as well. I've heard that Lifeproof cases make the audio really lousy for someone trying to listen on the other end. With my Otterbox case, I come in loud and clear (but I do wish the case was waterproof as an added protection and that the case was easier to remove).\n\nBattery life is good. I've had about two days of heavy usage where the phone was gasping for a charge by the time I got home. I turned on the battery saving mode, too. It might be nice to have a spare battery. I have a myCharge box and the phone doesn't seem to want to charge off of the available plugs but it WILL charge if you bring the USB cable that came with the phone and plug it into the myCharge USB port.\n\nIt's nice that the phone ringer is loud, because I have hearing issues from seasonal allergies and frequent sinus issues.

Love the NFC functionality with tap to pay. Lots of store clerks amazed when I pay with my phone. Decided to give droid another run after many years of being an iPhone user. Still love the iPhone but I have to say that android has improved over the years. Hate all of the bloat that the carrier adds to the device, seems wasteful if I never use those apps and many seem to drain the battery. Love the customization part of droid.

Here are my thoughts: This phone is a good size, large, but great for media. I don't have huge hands and I don't like that I can't reach my thumb comfortably across all the way to text with one hand. Touchwiz is a hate relationship for me, but for my grandparents a love relationship. I don't like all the samsung sludge that they install because it will slow down your phone. On the other hand, for my grandparents it is very simple, intuitive, and they have no complaints. The camera is great on this phone when it focuses well. Low light situations aren't always great, but that is the same for any device. The back speaker was hard to use after coming from an iPhone. I hate to admit it, but I am considering trying the 5s. One last note to be aware of, Samsung has a character flaw of their antennas not being so strong. If you are in a low service area, consider a Motorola device like the moto X.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: the screen, the speaker, the headphone jack, and the size\n\nCons: the battery could be better\n\ni love this phone. im a big music guy and its perfect, cant g a day without music.", "Pros: Excellent features, sound, and camera\n\nCons: Takes some getting used to.\n\nThis is my first smart phone, I thought it would be a problem.\nThanks to the Samsung people in Best Buy and a couple of other sales people, it has not been the problem I had thought it would be. I love the ease of operation and sound quality. The camera takes amazing pictures, just needed to set the resolution on lowest setting, otherwise it will take quite large pictures. You do need to research the apps you download, some can cause problems with the phone. Also if you use the wi-fi setting you may not use any of your carriers bandwidth (i.e AT&t)\ncall clarity is great, texting is simple and smooth. e-mail is great also, unless you have charter as an e-mail provider, then there can be problems accessing your e-mail on your pc while your phone is on.

I had this phone for over a month and previously I had Motorola X. Motorola X is about 2 years older than this one. You may have seen features in the tv ads where you hover your hand over screen and it shows text message body or if email is on, then content of it, but...I find them useless as I can easily click on text to see the content and to make it work, I need to keep my fingers awfully close to the screen...might as well click it! Also, these features are available with stock apps only.\nBattery life is all right, my moto X let me specify and customize battery usage, but not this phone. it feels everything is canned in it. I can't tell if this phone has a better batery life than my 2 year old phone.\nSound quality is all right as well, I definitely can't tell that I am not blown by quality. During calls I can barely hear a caller and have to activate boost feature to hear better, which is odd. Again, may sound repetitive, but I did not have to do anything with my Moto X to hear.\nSound control is odd too. I noticed that when I turn down the volume and set to vibrate not all the volumes (music, notifications) are set to vibrate at the same time, which is odd and I hate to go to volume settings and individually set them to vibrate. It tends to remember standalone settings, which is fine, but again, I don't want to go through multiple clicks to adjust them all.\nAlso, feels that the phone has a lot of features to customize, but I don't beleive they function right if you tweak them all. For instance, I turned off my repetitive notification alert sounds and it won't stick. I had to restart a couple of times before it took it.\nI don't know if it is Sprint (which kind of sucks in Iowa and Nebraska), but I barely can play videos or retrieve internet sites with it.

I love that the phone has a replaceable battery and additional storage on a SD card. The phone is much smoother and faster than my Iphone. It probably isnt a fair comparison because I switched from a Iphone 4S. I would say if you are switching from an Iphone there is a bit of a learning curve.

I did my research before buying this and it seemed to fit what I was looking for in a phone. Went to Best Buy and picked it out. First day: LOVED IT. Had a lot of fun getting used to the android system again after IOS for the last 2 years....was kind of refreshing! Charged it after letting battery run down. Day 2: Battery was definitely depleting faster, couldn't figure out why...running apps were closed and nothing running in background. Also, I would touch the email icon and the phone would reboot....touched the text message icon and the screen would go black. Not every time but definitely more than once. Returned it and Best Buy was very helpful and exchanged it for another one. I figured I must have just had one of those bad ones.\nSecond phone: Battery issue happened AGAIN by the 3rd day I was getting about 8 hours of battery without having any email on there to check, talk time 12 minutes, and having sent 11 texts total. Again, running apps closed. Took it in and they were finding that the google play store and other apps were opening back up on their own and running no matter how many times they were closed manually. I don't know what was going on. I've only every talked to one other person with an issue with this phone; everyone else seems to love it. I am hoping that I just had the bad luck of 2 bad phones and that noone else has to deal with it! I can say that Best Buy was VERY helpful with fixing it over all.

These are all great features if you can get the phone to work!\n\nAfter a 3 months of light use the home button on my S4 started sticking, popping, cracking... what ever you want to call it. So i sent my S4 to samsung repair center for a repair. After a 2 weeks of long wait i received my phone and surprise! it was not fixed and it was in an even worse condition so i could not even us the phone. Tech center says that they fixed my phone and the resolution was to replace a component and they would not even tell me what component it is. They did not do anything to my phone but messing it up. Phone was turning on and off every couple of seconds like crazy. After a bunch of phone calls i was told to send my phone to send again and wait another 2 weeks! So i decided to send and e mail to executive management of samsung to request a replacement and i received a big apology and an advise to send my phone repair center again. My entire experience with samsungs customer support was useless and a waste of time. All they did was to talk about their great policies that does not allow them to give me a replacement even their techs messed my phone up.\n\nSo this was my terrible experience with samsungs great high tech, high quality, super fast piece of junk and i wanted share it with you guys.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: picture quality, apps, sound\n\nCons: battery life could be bettet\n\nLove the phone.

It delivers with a speedy processor, great camera, and a large and clear screen. The phone can handle quite a bit and juggle multiple actions without losing a significant amount of battery power. The only real negative I can think of is that the phone promises some new and catchy features that aren't as easily usable as expected. I even had a Samsung rep show me how to access those features but it still is difficult to get them to work. What seemed quick and intuitive now appears to require more reading/learning about to use. The phone is also super lightweight and feels flimsy like it can crack in half just from being tucked into your pocket but so far so good.

That is completely false. I had the GS3 for eight months, and when I upgraded I noticed a huge difference. First, the display is bigger, and richer. It's an upgrade to a 4.7 inch screen, which at first intimidated me as I didn't want to sacrifice the size of the phone. No worries, Samsung simply slimmed down the bezels on the sides of the screen, making the screen larger yet the phone remains the same size of the GS3. Also, this display is 1080p, meaning the resolution provides a much clearer image. An awesome upgrade. The second thing I noticed was the 13MP camera blew my old GS3's out of the water. The hardware and software features make the camera easy and impressive. Especially the cool shooting modes such as panorama, action shot, ect. My only complaint on the camera is low-light shooting isn't the greatest. The last feature I'll highlight on is the 1.9Ghz quad-core processor, which clears up most of the lag usually experienced with android devices. The only real issue I've experienced with the phone is at my house it seems to drop/disconnect from my wifi every ten minutes or less. This may just be a firmware issue with my older router as I know the S4 has an upgraded wireless card that even supports AC-speed routers.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: sleek body, beautiful screen, customizable, and powerful\n\nCons: Battery life is minimal considering that the device is too powerful.\n\nMy first smart phone was the original droid and I loved it til the firmwares became unstable and slow. It would crash constantly. I then moved onto the iphone 4 because I wanted simplicity and functionality. However, as time went by the iphone became too bland and uninteresting. I decided to finally return to android and wow, they have come a long way unlike iOS which has remained relatively the same. It is everything I liked in the past and more than what I can imagine. The specs are phenomenal and it multitasks with ease. Most importantly, almost everything can be customized. The camera is also beautiful. But because it is so powerful, the phone's battery can drain quickly. I tend to keep a charger handy but this will not last a whole day of use for all the functions it can perform.

I got the 16gb version thinking I might be in trouble because I love downloading apps, music and taking pictures, but with a 32gb SD card I have no problem. The software upgrade that now allows you to save apps to your SD card was a huuuuuge improvement. Me and my girlfriend both got this phone and the ability to share pictures, music, files, etc. by tapping the phones together is awesome! Also, I watched a CNET.com durability test video and this phone can withstand A LOT! They dropped the phone around 10 times from 10ft and the phone still worked; They soaked it in water for a minute or two before it died, so they stuck it in rice for a day and the phone booted up fine the next day (the iPhone wasn't even close to being that durable: iPhone dropped once, done, soaked in water for under a minute, never turned back on.) The bloatware isn't that bad either, some of them are actually useful to use. I haven't had any problems with my phone either. My girlfriend had a problem where her gallery would freeze, but we deleted the folder in the gallery that was giving us trouble and then it worked fine. The picture files must have just become corrupted somehow, but the files were backed up in Google so we didn't lose the pictures, and they weren't corrupted .

I don't know if it's bug with my phone specifically or possibly a bug with the Samsung software.

I can manage it with 1 hand at times.\n\nCases/chargers/etc are easily available.\nI travel abroad, and although it IS unlocked (out of the box) for use internationally with a foreign carrier's SIM (I don't think you could use it on another US carrier though) - it took a while to figure out how to configure it. BUT, it is almost impossible to remove the sim card from the slot: you have to take out the battery, then use a pin or paper clip to push it out of the slot. And removing the micro SD card is even harder. Most people wont have those issues - once in, they will never remove the sim or memory cards.\nBottom line: Great phone for Android lovers!\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Awesome 13.0 MP Camera.\n\nCons: Difficult learning curve.\n\nI really like this phone. It's got some pretty cool features. It has long battery life. I like that I'm able to insert a micro SD up to 64 gb for picture and video. The screen size it is just right and its has an excellent 13mp camera.", "Pros: great apps, a beautiful camera and display, ease-of-use\n\nCons: battery is great, but running unwanted apps can be a drain\n\nswitching over from a Blackberry for the last seven years to an Android phone was quite a change. But when the Blackberry 10 came out I was not impressed and due for an upgrade. Could not be happier from day one that this phone. Since the majority of my work and pleasure is done with Google and Gmail, the Google play store was a great way to install I was familiar with. The Best Buy customer service was also fantastic in converting the Blackberry contacts over to the new phone. While the Blackberry feels a little bit sturdier, adding an otter box and a screen protector make this phone almost indestructible. I go full day on one charge with 25% left on average. The options of widgets and customizing screens could not be easier. But without a doubt the 13 megapixel camera takes the most beautiful pictures I've ever seen and the HD on video playback is outstanding. I do have to check what apps are running and close those were force stop some which are constantly running. it has its share of bloatware but synchronizing everything is so much easier than my Blackberry Bold. Typing on this seems a lot easier than on the iPhone, and the Google Now or the S. voice works as well as Siri when you need it.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Everything!\n\nCons: Delicate - need good case\n\nEasy to use, fast, efficient, good sound quality, fast processor, useful features and great battery life.

I am an \"average\" user. The phone is easy to use, has a great camera, great battery life, great display and is not slow or sluggish. The only two things I can say negatively is the shutter on the camera cannot be muted unless you mute the phone and the keyboard does not have an auto correct feature. I had to download a 3rd party app to get the auto correct feature.", "Pros: The size is just right and the sound is very good. I like both the front and rear cameras too!\n\nCons: I wish it had a larger internal memory\n\nSo far this is a good phone. The size and weight are just about right.

(heavy user)\n\nI purchased this phone the day that it came out, and I absolutely love it. There are so many features that I have yet to even explore, but the ones that I have used have been great. The WatchON app (IR remote control) app is AWESOME. It was so easy to set up, and I never have to search for my TV remote anymore. The camera is absolutely amazing - it blew my iPhone user friends out of the water this past weekend. The battery life isn't bad, but it could just be better. I'm a very heavy user, and it lasts me through the day, for the most part (Off charger at 6 a.m., needs to be on charger by 7-8 p.m.) I'm just used to a Moto Razr Maxx that has an extended battery. I had a bad experience with Samsung before, and swore I would never buy another phone that wasn't a Motorola, but this phone definitely won me over. I love my S4 so much that I went out and bought a Galaxy Note 8.0 tablet to go along with it 2 weeks later. I even bought this device at retail price, and it was definitely worth every penny!\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Speed. Battery life. Camera. Display.\n\nCons: Sound. Smart pause.\n\nOverall an excellent phone. Very fast when accessing apps and such. I like the fact that there are 2 gigs of ram, but hate that it is mostly sucked up right from the start. I was a little bummed at first about the quad core processor, but after seeing comparison benchmarks, it stays right with the octo-core nicely overall. I use my phone quite a bit throughout the day and battery life has been excellent. My biggest complaint is the sound. I suppose it is loud enough, but why put the speaker on the back. This stinks when watching videos.\nPhysically tough phone, as I have dropped it onto concrete and blacktop from about 3 feet with nothing more than a small dent in the plastic. So far very satisfied!", "Pros: size, screen, camera\n\nCons: switch from Apple, air motions don't work great for me\n\nI made the switch from the iPhone 5. I like the S4 so far. It was a fairly easy switch after I figured out what apps to use for music and photos since I was used to using iTunes and iPhoto. The screen is nice and videos look great on it. So do pictures. The camera is good for a phone camera. I am having trouble with the air motions, but may not be doing them correctly.", "Pros: user friendly, great camera and cool features\n\nCons: drops off network frequently\n\nThe phone is very user friendly, has awesome features. I love the Google extras that come up. I've discovered different events for my family with that app. The pictures it takes are awesome and the camera has cool features. It's surprisingly lightweight, even with large screen. Now when it comes to the actual phone part, I'm very disappointed. The phone frequently disconnects from the network, which causes me to miss calls and receive delayed text messages. I have to constantly restart my phone so it can reconnect. This is not happening in areas where service is poor. It will be running great and in the same location it will just stop working. I got a great deal on my phone. I just need to figure out how to have it stay on network.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: 13 megapixel camera\n\nCons: You can only use the text message alert sounds they give you.\n\nThe phone is super fast when it comes to internet use.

Customer service gets a rating of 0!!!", "Pros: picture quality\n\nPhone is a little bigger than I would like, only because I like to put my phone in my pocket. Seems like huge phones are the trend right now. This is one of the smaller ones available without going to a mini. Picture quality is good. Ease of adding and uninstalling apps is nice. I've had this phone for a little over a month overall good. Only real issue I've had is from time to time I have to push the home button to active the screen or sometimes twice when normally I have to push it once. I thought it was a setting I messed up, but I have noticed it switches from normal function to this and back on its on. If it switches to wanting me to hit the home button for silly stuff if I turn the phone off for a while it usually goes back to normal use when I turn it back on.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: picture quality is great\n\nCons: Battery could last longer\n\nGreat phone.

The sound quality is great. The screen is responsive. Other that having some initial trouble importing music from itunes and synching Holidays with the calendar (which the Geek Squad helped with), it's a great phone!", "Pros: Screen size. Ease of maintaining files.\n\nCons:\nThis is my first venture into the world of android/Samsung after many years with Apple. My main reason for switching was for the larger screen. However, now that I have had time to get familiar with phone and android software, I am hooked. Especially pleased with the ability to control and manipulate data and files and pictures, etc. I would be a guaranteed long term fan if it were not for one downside.\n\nThe down side, and unfortunately this is a huge downside, is battery life. Is worse than I could have ever imagined. I am in a constant struggle to manage my usage and screen brightness just to make it through a full day on a single charge. This absolutely must be remedied.

Not as easy as I had anticipated.\n\nI'm delighted that I chose the SGS4! I'm excited and still learning about all the features. I love the camera, the multi-window, and using the voice to control the volume when I'm listening to music! The SGS4 is by far the best phone on the market and I'm the envy of my kids who are stuck with their Iphones for now. I can customize my phone to use the features that suit my lifestyle and and change any of them in an instant! I'm just a happy camper all around with my SSG4!", "Pros: The feel of the phone, its light. Love the screen size\n\nI dont know why everyone is talking about that it feels fake because its not made out of metal. I love how light it is. This is my 3rd Samsung smart phone and I dont think I will be switching anytime soon. I just picked up the phone today, from the box to the power up its amazing. Feels great in my hand very easy to use. The best part is I only paid 3 dollors for it because of the Bestbuy trade in. But i would of paid full prize for it if I had to. The only thing I can complain about is Verizon took forever to release it", "Pros: battery life, quick charge, clear pictures, hands free, the volume puts out great sound\n\nCons: We are very pleased with our purchase.\n\nThe only problem we had was our cashier.

It took a little getting used to but am coming around pretty well with it, & I am not the smartest with all this new technical stuff.

Coming from a broken Lumia 1020, she found it very easy to operate and set up. The camera takes great pictures. Expandable memory is great. Having it on At&t is a plus with free cloud storage and super fast data speed. The battery is better than the Lumia 1020 for sure, but not as good as my LG G2. The price at Best Buy was unbeatable and we got a free Galaxy Tab3!", "Pros: Gaze technology,price was a steal\n\nCons: awkward size to hold for smaller hands\n\nVery pleased with this phone overall. My first smart phone and it has been relatively easy to adjust to using this versus a plain jane cell phone. Battery life has been very good, and I like the apps available.

I'm computer savvy, so it was easy for me to pick up, but may find a bit tricky for those not as proficient. Fast, great photo quality, no issues with call reception.

However, this phone and the staff at Best Buy made it easy. Both the salesman and the Samsung rep gave me allot of time and instruction to get started. The manuals provided are also easy to follow and very informative. The best part is the feature rich phone, lots of great apps bundled and actually works well as a phone too-imagine that! The sound volume and quality are fantastic, with tools to custom tweak it to an old guys bad ears. The Android operating system and the bundled apps are all very intuitive and easy to use.

Getting that phone was a whole 'nother terrible Best Buy experience.\n\n3 months later, the phone doesn't get dropped, but apparently the LED breaks. Best Buy once again wants $150.

I'll focus on a couple things. Overall, I am happy with the phone. The picture is great, whether looking at pictures, reading news/posts/webpages, watching a movie or playing a game. The battery life is short. The camera is great under the right circumstances, unacceptable in others. Outside in bright light the camera is great. I especially love the \"best face\" mode that takes 10 quick shots allowing you to save one or all #the saving part is a little time consuming and you can't take more pictures until complete#. I used it to catch good shots of the kids on rides at Disney, for example, when it's hard to frame and time to moving subject. Indoors in average lighting the camera is a failure. It is slow to focus and take pictures, and the pictures are usually blurry. Perhaps the flash needs to fire, but it isn't firing in auto mode. Finally, two mornings in a row, with my camera left in the truck overnight with temperatures at/below 30 #no phones allowed at work#, the camera hasn't woken up until it got warmer.

While you can turn it horizontal, the keyboard takes up nearly the whole screen and you cannot see the message you are responding to.\n\nIt is fairly easy to use and it is very light, but the cost (with Verizon, who doesn't discount as much) and lack of keyboard are a turn off.\n\nNo problems with the Best Buy staff, they did a great job, but I would try something different.", "Pros: Big screen\n\nCons: in call volume is low sometimes\n\nThe phone is great. screen is big and the picture quality is good. its really light and takes great pictures.

Always have a charging source available\n\nSamsung and 3rd party accessory suppliers are way behind.\nAll states going to hands free. Where are car docking stations? The type to slip the phone in and go on, like the droid had available.? Takes too much effort to put in generic holder then plug in power (needed).\nMay sound minor, but wait till you see the power consumption for display or use it regularly for navigation,", "Pros: Screen Clarity\n\nCons: The spell suggest is not as good as my stratosphere was.\n\nI love the clarity and size of the screen. The keypad for texting, swyping, and dialing the phone is good sized and makes it easier to hit the correct keys. It wasn't a huge learning curve to switch from the Samsung Stratosphere to the Galaxy S IV. The ability to use the camera or the internet while you are on a phone conversation is a huge plus!", "Pros: great picture, great call quality, dependable\n\nCons: nothing\n\nI had the iPhone 4S and upgraded to the Galaxy S4 and I couldn't be happier.

The camera is great and fairly simple to use (compared to DSLR and the like) and takes better-than-point-and-shoot pictures with features like animated photos and Drama Shots as well. The screen is perfect; don't take my word or any other reviewers' for that matter - go look at one for yourself. The interface is not laggy as others have mentioned so I'll chalk that up to usage styles. I came from a TBolt, so this is the holy grail of phones to me. If you have a GS3, I can acknowledge the argument that the GS4 isn't new *enough*, but I still don't agree (read opinion). The GS4 is just faster, so much faster.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: picture and video\n\nCons: battery life isn't great\n\nI'm satisfied with this phone but the battery life is short.

Welcome to the future! This phone is sooooooo customizable. I'm still in shock. Just get one, try it out for yourself. Great for techies, however, there is an easy mode too. I love my 3rd Gen. iPad, it's got a big beautiful screen. Now I love my S4 for all the same reasons. Loads of FREE apps. Expandable memory. Too much to list!", "Pros: NFC, great camera, holds a lot of music.\n\nCons: Can be cunbersome to get into the modification of featrures. Battery life could be better..\n\nThe GS4 has all the features I have come to enjoy from my previous Samsung phone. NFC Tags are really nice and a great way to activate features just by hitting the phone to a NFC Tag. The video upgrade to slow motion is very nice along with the upgraded interface to the basic camera.\n\nSetting up the phone was really simple and did not take a lot of time. The coverage from inside the cab of my truck is really better than expected. The Bluetooth integration to my truck head unit is seamless and works better than my old GS3.\n\nThere are lots of accessories for the phone and the number of quality cases was astounding. I hope the phone will last me for 2 or 3 years before I need to upgrade to obtain better features.\n\nThe bottom line is the phone is easy to set up, works well, integrates to my head unit and PC well, and makes posting pictures to forums and social media very easy.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Incredible screen, good features\n\nCons: price, not the best battery life\n\nGreat new phone.

Plus intrusive Google apps and ads.\n\nI've had mobile phones dating back to my big clunker in 1980 that took up a portion of the trunk of my car. Have had small mobile phones for 20 years and the two Samsung models I've had (including this one) covering the past three years are the worst for simply using them for pure phone calls. The volume levels are horrendous unless you annoy the person you are speaking with by switching to speaker phone. And - yes - I know how to set the volume levels and options.\n\nSecond is the poor location of the on/off switch/button. It's located right where you grip the phone so it can accidentally be shut off very easily.\n\nThird is very annoying. The phone is constantly being bombarded with ads for obscure products like diet, insurance, and other nonsense along with the deluge of ads suggesting new apps.\n\nLast is the intrusive applications of Google, Samsung, and my carrier - Sprint. They suck up valuable storage space and many cannot simply be deleted as well as providing provisioning to never see or hear from these annoying companies again.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: easy to use.\n\nCons: Short battery life,it does not take the phone long before it is hot. Not great speaker text. Gets the words wrong.\n\nThis is only my 3rd smart phone, but it is leaps and bounds better then the other two I had, had. I have NOT dropped a call yet, and I have been using it in some pretty rural area's. Driving cross country in the upper part of the US, through OR, WA, Montana, WY and SD. Canyons, valley's, Mountain area's. I am Amazed at not only did I not drop a call, but I have not said \"Can you hear me\" since I have had it! The camera is good, not to much delay. I am still learning, but so far I am very happy with it, and highly recommend it.", "Pros: Camera and video features are great\n\nI like this phone, it has fun and useful camera features and is very easy to set up. It would be nice if the settings you set would stay when you return but then again the normal settings are good for most things. It has a few features I will never use but I can see how others may enjoy them. I have used it as a GPS and MP3 player and it is great for both and as an MP3 player it ran all day 14 hrs. nonstop and only used 20% of the battery.

The features are robust and there are tons and tons of apps for Android. I like being in an open platform. I drive a Ford Edge and the S4 will sync with my car and allow me to read and send text messages from the driver's console. The iPhone wouldn't sync with my car.", "Pros: Great HD Camera\n\nCons: Speaker on the back is not ideal\n\nI bought the phone the day before my 1st daughter's 1st b-day. I don't own a camera or a video camera. Now I don't need either. The camera and video camera on this phone are better than most cameras. The video quality is amazing, internet surfing is seamless.\n\nThe negative, it doesn't sync with my iTunes, but I knew that going in.", "Pros: It has a bigger screen than Iphone and the sound is much clearer.\n\nCons: Its battery dies really really really fast.\n\nI am happy with most of the features of this phone, but I can't believe how fast the battery dies. I charge it everyday twice, when I am not the kind of person who is holding the phone 24/7.", "Pros: Light weight. Longer battery life. Camera is excellent.\n\nNo complaints at all.

Great value.", "Pros: Look, feel, easy touch, easy read, great camera\n\nCons: Lower ring tone than what I used to have\n\nExcellent overall. Texting much easier than what I had. Good battery life, good color.

There are great videos available to help learn and/or operate some of the features. I have reduced the use of my laptop with this phone! I could go on and on about the really cool features too. 2 features I am discouraged about is the volume of the ringer and the weakness of the vibrate feature. My old phone's alarm woke me by vibrating, I can sleep through the vibration this phone produces.", "Pros: Improved battery life, Screen resolution, Camera resolution\n\nCons: Metal frame, functionality of recognition features\n\nI swapped from the S3 to the S4 after owning the S3 for 10 months. The S4 is a marked improvement to the Galaxy line. Most noteworthy is the improvement in battery life. I average about 18 hours of life from my phone with normal use. Under heavy use obviously that number is reduced, but like most people checking Facebook, texting, occasional YouTube use, it lasts from morning until bed.\n\nThe phone itself is ideal for my hand size. I'm 6' tall and average build for what that's worth. My wife also has one and finds it to be quite nice as well.\n\nA few changed features include the option to customize the home screen more as well as the quick access toolbar on the top. It doesn't seem like much, but it's quite nice.\n\nThe screen quality is up there. Samsung is known for the high-definition screens, and the resolution on the phone shows that.\n\nOverall I'd give the phone a 9.5/10. There have been lag issues and a needed patch was sent OTA to fix some bugs but overall the experience with this phone is leagues ahead of the S3 I had and is much more intuitive and, in my opinion, a nicer feel in the firmware than my iPhone 5 for work.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Relatively easy to use and features are excellent!\n\nCons: Size is sometimes cumbersome\n\nImpressed with the call quality, camera and video.

Very good phone.", "Pros: Easy to use OS, compatible with iTunes\n\nCons: hands free gestures can get annoying\n\nI went from the Droid DNA to the GS4 and it was a very nice transition. Although the DNA was extremely powerful, The Galaxy S4 it just as powerful if not more. I can multitask very quickly and it keeps up without freezing up of force closing anything. I also love the camera. Even the front facing camera has better quality than other phones rear facing. I also got the flip cover with the window and that as well it pretty cool. I recommend finding out for yourself which of the hands free gestures to leave on. If all of them are on, the phone is a bit too controlling. Meaning it tries to do things that you may not want it to do. For example if your watching a video and you just slightly look away, it pauses even if your eyes are still on it. Not a huge deal but either way its still the best thing on the market. Oh and i almost forgot, my whole iTunes library transferred over super easy.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: The vivid screen and great camera\n\nCons: nothing so far\n\nI am very pleased with this phone.

This phone can do and has everything!", "Pros: So many features\n\nCons: Sometimes the battery lasts less than a day\n\nI bought the S4 after I had the Droid X for a long time. My son has the S3 and loves it. He told me I had to get the S4 because it is the best phone ever! I am still learning how to use many of the features of the phone, but I use it mainly to text, talk, internet and as a music player. It also takes great pictures and video. Some days the battery life is not as long as I would like but just like any phone it depends on how much you use it. Overall this is a top notch phone! I use the otter box so I am not concerned as much about the durability.", "Pros: Great size, screen, and GUI environment\n\nCons: Too thin, button placement\n\nMade the switch from Apple and I am very pleased.\nHas so many BETTER features than Apple, plus more apps and more free apps especially.\nTwo \"complaints\" (but not deal breakers, just need to change next time). TOO thin. I find a little more thickness would help prevent it from sliding in my hand as much as it does. Second...POOR design having the volume buttons exactly opposite the Sleep button; holding it with one hand, like everyone does, you hit one when trying to push the other--Apple does have that right with the Sleep on top.", "Pros: It's not a stupid iPhone\n\nCons: Battery life is starting to show it's butt.\n\nI jumped ship after having the iPhone 3g and 4. I got sick of their phones slowly breaking down. Battery life was rapidly diminishing, and the antenna always started to die after about 18 months. Had enough. Decided to go with the Galaxy S4, and have not regretted the move.\n\nThe Galaxy S4 has a much larger screen and better graphics, bar none. I haven't had any problems with my phone, thus far, with the exception that the battery life is starting to show it's age. Perhaps I am having so much fun on my phone that I just end up draining a strong battery? I don't know. But, I am having to put it on the charger before bedtime on a daily basis now.\n\nAndroid system took some getting used to after having an iPhone all these years. However, I picked up on it rather easily. Love the features that are included on this phone, but neglected on the iPhone, such as speech to text available any time the keyboard is accessed. The one minor problem with that is that you can't have any background noise or the recognition program inserts unintended words.\n\nThis phone will make it very difficult for me to go \"off grid\" someday!\n\nMy only regret is that I didn't wait long enough for the waterproof version to come out.

Each generation is superior to the previous generation. All are excellent devices, but I like my S4 the best because of it's huge screen size (huge, yet not as big as the Galaxy Note 2.0's screen, which in my opinion is a little too big to comfortably carry in my front pocket#.\n\nIgnore the people that complain about the phone being made from plastic, they don't know what they're talking about. Plastic is the perfect thing to make phones from. Samsung uses high quality plastics, and obviously continues to make phones from plastic because it's lightweight, durable, break resistant if dropped, and cheaper to manufacture than aluminum or other metals. Frankly, I would be disappointed if Samsung switched to metals because I love how thin and lightweight their phones #including the S4# are!\n\nHere's another consideration that most people probably aren't aware of, but that makes a huge difference to some of us...Samsung uses excellent, strong Bluetooth radios in their phones. I have to admit, I'm addicted to Bluetooth devices. I always have a fully-charged Bluetooth headset within reach #and carry one in my pocket for phone calls while I'm out and about#! In case you're wondering, I like the Plantronics M-100 #and M1100# models since they stay snugly in my ear without using an earhook #but after putting on the largest eargel included#. I also use Stereo Bluetooth headsets whenever I'm working out or relaxing in the spa. I like Motorola S9-HD #they're water resistant) and I have some Plantronics 903+ that I like to wear when I'm laying back since the wire that connects the two headsets is very comfortable to lean back on). In any event, some phones have very weak Bluetooth radios built in, which means bad connections/audio dropouts. Every Samsung phone I've owned has had great Bluetooth transmitters, meaning I can wander sometimes 20 feet or so from my phone and still retain a clear connection. I haven't always had good luck ...\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Ease of use, good battery life, great screen\n\nCons: might be too big for small hands\n\nI am still learning about the many useful features on this phone.

It won't replace my cameras but when I forget my camera I can use my phone to take great photos and I don't have to worry about quality. There are wonderful camera features as well included so I can edit the pictures right on the phone. Battery life could be better but I do get about 2 days on one charge so I really don't have that much of an issue with the battery.

I honestly believe it's the best smarty phone on the market, bar none!\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: camera, widgets, apps, speed\n\nCons: not necessarily easy to use for some\n\nMy wife switched to this phone from her iPhone 4. So far she's had it for about 1 month and has been quite content with it. I have the Galaxy S2 and in terms of comparison, the battery life is much better on the S4. The camera features are great. I've had to show my wife the ropes a little in terms of some of the functionalities of the phone. She's had some issues with getting texts from some people, but it's probably just a setting I need to look at. Overall she keeps saying that she's glad she switched from the iPhone.", "Pros: Picture, size, options\n\nCons: Viewing webpages\n\nI have only one complaint. The phone flips from web page to another without touching the phone. It makes it difficult to look up information.", "Pros: Long lasting battery, and great picture quality\n\nCons: Some systems tend to freeze screen\n\nOverall, this is a great upgrade phone. Love the picture quality and ease of apps.", "Pros: Great price, so easy to use (no instructions needed), Great Camera\n\nCons: So far nothing. It is all good.\n\nThis is my first \"touch\" camera. I researched available phones and picked this one and it is a winner. It is so easy to use. It fits right in my pocket and it is a very sturdy phone. Versatile and the camera is better than my regular camera and much more convenient. Transfer and printing of pictures is easy. Just love this phone. The only question is why didn't I do it sooner.... makes my live so easy. Highly recommend this phone! I love Apple products but this Samsung has better features that the new Apple IPhone so that is why I purchased it over the Apple. Also the camera is better.", "Pros: Large screen. Fast downloads.\n\nCons: Short battery life. Speaker isn't very loud\n\nPhone works good for what I needed. The battery could last longer though. Speaker isn't very loud.", "Pros: speed, apps,\n\nCons: data usage is high\n\nI love the new phone, the pictures, the graphics, sound, speed, are wonderful. The battery goes a lot longer, .... very happy with it", "Being a previous owner of the galaxy s3 I would recommend this phone. I thought the s3 was the best phone I've owned so far and getting the s4 is like getting that same great phone with many added features. Better camera, faster processor, touch less web browsing, slightly bigger screen, bigger battery, and other features make the galaxy s4 that much more worth it. Glad best buy brought down the price. If your in the market for a full featured pretty much can do anything smart phone pick up the galaxy s4.", "Pros: great for pictures and to delete emails\n\nCons: short battery life\n\nthe phone at first intimidated me since my last phone was a little flip top.

I find that this phone has more functionality than my wife's iphone and is more user friendly and better customization. I'm not sure how different the 4 is from the galaxy 5 but for me, the 4 is perfect.", "Pros: excellent video and camera, awesome screen resolution\n\nCons: battery life is just above average, speaker sound is just good\n\nThis phone was a replacemant for my motorola droid bionic.

SAMSUNG GALAXY S4.(BETTER)", "Pros: the camera, the call volume, the ease of downloading apps\n\nCons: battery life - i have not learned how to kill running apps\n\nThis phone replaced my iphone 4s. It has been a great choice so far.\nI love the pictures it takes, the sound volume is great. the battery life sucks but i think thats my fault because i have a lot of open apps.", "Pros: You can do so much with this phone\n\nCons: Just a little big to use with one hand\n\nOnce you know how to use the functions this phone is great. It really is like a mini computer in your pocket. I love the clarity of the screen. Overall a great phone.", "Pros: The picture quality is great\n\nI have only had this phone for a little over a month. So far it has been easy to use. The battery life is better that what I had The photos are so much clearer", "Pros: Speed, power, clarity, ingenuity, long battery life and design\n\nCons: not many\n\nI love this phone. Its a little powerhouse in a compact design. It charges quickly and holds a charge for a long long time. the design is sleek and elegant.", "Pros: great speed\n\nCons: i have dropped a few calls...may just be Verizon issue\n\nI was looking for a phone with better speed and this does the trick. Picture quality is awesome, great color and clarity.", "Pros: Good sound. Excellent screen.\n\nCons: Short battery life\n\nI love my new phone. It works perfectly except fir the fact that I went from an iPhone to a Samsung. This made it very diffucult to receive texts from IPhones. I wish the sales person would have told m me what I needed to do to make this transition.", "I've had the S2 for the last 2 years. It's been ok for what it is supposed to be used for; calling people. However the battery didn't have much of a life and had to order a MONSTER battery. The S4 seems to last a little longer, but for my Disney trips I will take a backup just in case. I like the picture quality on this phone and the picture options. I love that I can quiet my phone when someone that I don't want to speak to by simply turning it over, so they don't feel rejected. LOL Everything else seems pretty much the same.", "Pros: Easy to use\n\nCons: Using all the apps on the phone not knowing what they do\n\nThis phone has a great camera and is easy to use. The battery life on the phone is good and it's pictures are great quality.

A bit large to fit comfortably in hand or pocket, but a nice screen size to play with.", "Pros: Picture Quality if fantastic\n\nCons: No comments\n\nNice phone, picture quality is fantastic, battery life is pretty good so far. Could improve the speakers but hey it is a phone. Overall, recommended buy to upgrade.", "Pros: Easy to set up.\n\nCons: Size, battery needs charging more often.\n\nAs this was my first smart phone, I had some fears about using this device. However, everything has gone smoothly. I am sure I am still not using this device to its full capabilities, but I am having fun learning how to do things! The size of the device is a little awkward (seems a bit too large), but I do appreciate the larger screen for viewing.", "Pros: Everything\n\nCons: A little bulky, But...\n\nThe S4 is an awesome phone and although it is a little bulky, I would not want the screen to be any smaller. It has Great Camera, and I really appreciate the Smart Text", "Pros: really not hard to set up\n\nCons: so far nothing\n\nas it shows above, the call and picture quality is excellent. Considering what the device does the battery life is not bad at all.\nAll in all a very good device.", "Pros: Great battery life, great picture quality\n\nThis is my first SmartPhone, and the S4 does everything I could want from it, in fact it is much smarter than me. It has great battery life, I charge it up to 100% and it lasts until the next morning, with much texting, talking and words with friends. It is pretty amazing. The BestBuy associates were very helpful, they put on the Otter Cover for me. I have not put on the clear screen cover as I have seen it is pain to apply. No problems so far with screen scratching.", "Pros: ease of use, powerful tools\n\nCons: battery life could be better\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S4 is really a PC wrapped up in a smartphone. Ease of use and practical applications combine to make a powerful tool. A big enough screen allows you to view and edit documents. And the camera is excellent.", "Pros: Easy to use\n\nCons: Doesn't have some features of my old phone\n\nThey always want us to write these reviews when we just got the product and are in the honeymoon phase. Well, that didn't last that long for me. I do like the phone. It has a larger screen, faster processor and more storage. But: 1) the Nav system that comes with it seems a generation before the one on my 3 year old phone; 2) it won't return a call from a voicemail message; 3 it wouldn't sync with my home Wi-Fi without a service call; and 4, although it is supposedly set up to it won't get my primary e-mail from Yahoo. Also, the ring tone strength is pretty wimpy. These are major enough to write about. It does have better coverage though (through Verizon) and the quality is clear if a little different sounding in a way I can't describe - but nothing really noticeable of bad. The bigger scree in great and it still fits in my pocket. According to Best Buy it has a superior screen to my old one. There are some things I have to learn still and I will have Verizon look at the e-mail issue and that could make for a more positive review. But overall, I am happy with it.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: smooth web, great battery, great photos\n\nCons: hard time accessing key pad mid call to use for options.\n\nUp until now I have never liked smart phone web experiences.

After searching I chose the Samsung Galaxy S4. It works fine all around. Sound is great, call quality is great, and operation is easy to use especially for those who are already familiar with Samsung devices like myself. Power down and start up are relatively quick and the device charges relatively quickly as well. I am very happy with my purchase.", "Pros: The screen is not too big, just right. Easy to use, lightweight, battery life is excellent.\n\nCons: I don't have anything negative to report.\n\nI absolutely love this phone. It's got a big enough screen to see what you're doing, the battery life is great, it's user friendly, has a ton of cool features. I used to have an iPhone and am not disappointed one bit with the switch to the galaxy.", "Pros: Amazing screen, fast, perfect size for my big hands, high quality camera, and my battery lasts all day.\n\nCons: I would have preferred a little less bloatware.\n\nI'm glad I chose this phone. I was also considering the Note 3 and iPhone 5s. I took a chance on the Galaxy S4 mostly because it was \"free\"(two year contract, taxes and upgrade fee).\nI'm glad I did, it's an excellent phone.", "Pros: fast, large screen, great colors, good reception\n\nCons: Plastic back cover\n\nThis is a great phone super fast processor. I love the screen resolution, I havnt been able to get HDMI working but could be that I need to replace my cable", "Pros: Great camera and battery life better than Galaxy 3. would definitely recommend to friends.\n\nBattery life better than Galaxy 3. would definitely recommend to friends. Sound is not too good during phone calls, but not so bad where I would hate this phone. Love love love it.", "When making calls my speaker tends to act funny until the person picks up.

I did the compare with the new iPhone and this phone and instead of going with the new iPhone with their minimum changes I went with something new and so happy with the change for all the many things I was missing out on. The call quality is much much better, actually everything is. Plus it's just as easy to use as the iPhone. The only thing I.dont like is that the pictures seem to take a little time to take the picture it's a few nanosecond if anything but sometimes is a little delayed and that is about it.", "Pros: Easy to read, screen is large and battery lasts!\n\nCons: Nothing!\n\nI love this phone. It is my second smart phone and I love the large screen which makes it easy to read. The screen resolution is excellent and the brightness perfect. A little hard to read in bright light, but I think that may be true for any phone.", "Pros: The size and screen clarity.\n\nCons: Nothing yet\n\nPurchased this phone to replace an old dumb phone which was falling apart.\n\nI decided to go \"HI TECH\" and the sales person suggested the Samsung Galaxy S4. It was a good deal and exactly what I was looking for. It is the right size and satisfies my expectations.", "Pros: camera. size\n\nCons: metro pcs service\n\nI like the appearance and design of the phone. the camera is great.

It is unavailable a lot and when it is I cannot use my data services.", "Pros: more colorful and better camera\n\nCons: battery life and takes forever to charge\n\nI like the bigger screen and the camera and vibrant colors. I also likes the words that it remember s to populate. I always misspell with the keyboard. The phone takes forever to charge and the battery doesn't last long.", "Pros: Hyper functional, full customization, and the best all in one phone.\n\nCons: Plastic feel, not a 41MP camera, and battery could last longer than 1 day.\n\nWent with the best android phone and it payed off. So many features, super high specs, will be the first phone to get updates, easy to get accessories, large and brilliant display, and plenty of space for your 1,000 apps. The 13MP camera is one of the best on the market but without a better image stabilizer of the G2 or the higher resolution of the Lumia 1020 it isn't necessarily \"the best\". Battery is much better than any other phone I've had and after heavy use for 2 months now I can go 18 hours playing games, listening to music, and texting without having to worry about the charger and my battery manager says that at 99% it can go 3 days with slight use. The black is sleek and stylish with a patterned but not textured backing. The physical button on the front takes some getting used to if you're coming from an older android device with a touch home button. All and all a terrific phone and I would recommend it to even the stingiest of Iphone users.\n\u00ab collapse", "Cons: Short battery life, screen is Extremely fragile\n\nI had this phone for less than two weeks and the screen went black. It had been in a case since the day I bought it and then looking closely there was a tiny crack on the lcd. I brought back to the store and they told me they couldnt do anything for me. I would never buy another phone here. I found their salespeople to not care about the customer after they have made their purchase. They lost a loyal customer for life.", "Pros: Easy to move music too\n\nCons: Horrid battery life. Camera isn't all that great.\n\nI thought it would have a better camera, it does things that I still have no clue how to stop, like trying to look up something on the web and it brings up the last thing I looked at instead. It's slower then my iPhone was. It has too many steps to just make a phone call. I'm not over happy with it. The only thing going for it is that it's simple to get music on.", "Pros: everything. calls are clear. videos look great. phone runs smooth. long battery life.\n\nMy phone is used primarily for personal use.

This phone has become one of my favorite tech items I have bought this year.", "Pros: numerous helpful features\n\nCons: can be complicated for first time Android users\n\nLove the display quality and uncovering all the features this phone has. Wish the user guide would describe them in full detail but YouTube videos are very helpful. Great speaker sound quality, however the call quality can sometimes be a little off.Always having to use the additional boost of sound quality in all my calls, maybe this feature should come standard instead. Absolutely love how it's very compatible to my electronic family (ex: TV,blue ray player, Google tablet). Overall very satisfied with this model, not to mention it's weightlessness with so much power and not very bulky.", "Pros: Easy to navigate\n\nCons: no complaints\n\nI had an Galaxy S2 before the S4 and I enjoy the features & the look. If you want to invest in a fantastic upgrade this will be money well spent.", "Pros: easy to use\n\nCons: battery life isn't that great\n\nI love this phone so far. However, the battery quality is not the best. I fully expected there to not be a GREAT battery quality though from having other smart phones. This has an awesome camera on it though. We were on vacation and I was taking pictures from a shuttle that we were on through the window and the pictures were coming out amazingly clear. They were not blurry at all. I would highly recommend this phone to anyone.", "Pros: for PC people everything makes sense. does not us propritary chargers or connectors\n\nCons: so far so good. Much better than iPhone\n\nAt last, a phone that makes sense for us PC people out there. The operating system, phone and camera are work great. no more ever changing propriatry connectors / chargers and limititaions of having to use itunes. More options large impressive screen good battery life. Thank you Samsung!", "Pros: screen size, customized set up\n\nI purchased this phone for my husband only after I had one myself. He was originally going to have my iPhone 4 as his first smart phone. After comparing the two, he also wanted the bigger screen... which meant that he'd have more room for his fingers to use the keyboard. He's very happy with the sharing features, how easy it is to customize himself. It ended up being a great surprise", "Pros: It was free.\n\nCons: The app update process.\n\nThis is an awesome phone, even if it wasn't free. It's everything the iPhone should have been which is why I left the Apple ecosystem.\n\nI particularly like the ability to use the power button to put the phone into aiirplane mode. Swiping down on any of the main screens brings up a list of essential functions (wifi, bluetooth, GPS, etc) that you can turn off or on as needed,\n\nThe app update process is a bit problematic. There are times when an app updates, the phone notifies you that the SD card has been disconnected. The only way to reconnect the card is to restart the phone. If you have any apps installed on your card that you're trying to start up or have been running during the process, this can be a bit problematic (not to mention frustrating).\n\nOverall it's a great phone once you get past that discrepancy.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: bigger and better screen, camera/video functions, everything about this phone!!!\n\nCons: Can break/shatter easily without a proper protective case(otterbox defender series recommended)\n\nGREAT phone for the price, great new features and larger screen....Would recommend over the Apple IPhone", "Pros: everything\n\nCons: Call quality with a life proof case on\n\nCan't express how much I enjoy using this device. Have always gotten the better phones on the market and this truly is the best phone on the market. Doesn't compare to anything I've ever used. My only issue is hearing during a phone call. The sound quality isn't great with the life proof case on, but the protection is necessary.", "Pros: Picture,Speed, Picture\n\nCons: Battery\n\nI had waited on updating my phone and when this one was free over the black friday weekend i jumped on it. Most of the reviews are good for the phone but the one thing that does hold true is it does suck up battery.\n\nStill trying to figure out most of the features but other than the battery life I do like this phone", "Pros: Easy to use, large screen\n\nThis phone is excellent for those looking for something other than a iPhone. It is easy to use, has a HUGE screen in comparison and has great features. The phone takes beautiful pictures with the front and back cameras.

Calls are crisp, smartphone features, are awesome, camera is better than all other smartphones, and a few digital cameras. Thank you, Samsung, you totally own the market.", "Pros: Useability!\n\nCons: Nothing\n\nEverything about this phone is great. The sound quality, camera, ease of use, apps, andoid has cone a long way and its so great.", "Pros: Speed, call quality, graphics\n\nCons: Battery life, casing is in plastic\n\nI really like this phone. It has an excellent display and is very fast with the quadcore processor. It connects much more easily to my home network where my iPad has a difficult time and requires a router reset. The only downside is the plastic casing. The back plate is plastic and feels cheap. I wish it had a higher quality/more durable casing like the extruded aluminum used in the iPhone. Supposedly this is going to be corrected as the S5 is going to be made of carbon fiber or the likes of stronger materials. Warning, This phone with the otter box commuter case will not withstand being run over by a snowmobile. Learned the hard way.

I read many reviews that the battery life was terrible but it is not true! I am a heavy texter, constantly using social media like facebook, twitter, instagram, and take a lot of pictures and my battery lasts all day! approx 9am-8 or 9pm until i get a 30% battery life. So this is great! also the camera quality and video quality is awesome! The trick is to turn off the extra stuff when not in use and your battery will last long too.", "Pros: Nice camera features\n\nCons: Phone is too big. Can't type with one hand easily. Short battery life.\n\nAlthough this phone was free, I will be going back to an iPhone when my upgrade is available. Many of my songs from iTunes did not transfer to this phone. Phone is too big to handle with one hand when needed.", "Pros: Easy to use and lots of features\n\nCons: Call quality is good but could be better\n\nI replace my HTC Lightning-Bolt for the Samsung S4 and glad I did.

The battery is great, last all day on a single charge and I am so glad I made this purchase.", "Pros: Outstanding value.\n\nCons: Needs screen protector.\n\nI have used a variety of top Smart Phones for many years for business and personal use. The Galaxy S4 is BY FAR the BEST Smart Phone value I have seen. Applications are too numerous to mention, the screen is very sharp and provides excellent images, phone voice call quality is superior to iPhone and BlackBerry. I have relied on this device for many daily applications in the US and across Europe. I would highly recommend.", "Pros: Camera, Fast processor.\n\nCons: Predictive text isn't the best. Too many preinstalled apps.\n\nBeen an iPhone user for years... first the 3G, then the 4, so was a bit hesitant to upgrade, but very glad I did. This phone blows the iPhone out of the water. The switch from iOs to Android has a bit of a learning curve, but once you get used to it, you'll never go back. This phone has so many features, some of which I know I will never use, but this thing is fast. Pages load very quickly. Tap.. BAM.. its there. Display is very nice, and just the right size. The phone fits in my pocket no problem. All in all, this is a great phone. And yeah, it makes phone calls too.\nI loved the iPhone, but Apples' complacency is leaving them in the dust.", "Pros: It's really easy to use and the camera is great.\n\nCons: Occasionally the touch screen stops working. Kinda annoying\n\nThis is a great phone, however, after having it for a month, the touch screen occasionally stops working. It starts right up again, but it can be annoying while playing a game or texting.", "Pros: Predictive text is excellent\n\nCons: Nothing yet\n\nI had the Samsung Galaxy 2, and could not believe all the improvements in the Galaxy 4! Predictive text works great. I love the numerals at the top of the keyboard because there is less shifting around screens. The browser works like my other computers meaning I don't feel shortchanged when searching on it. I have bad health and spend lots of time in hospitals. This phone/ camera/ computer makes those stays \"enjoyable!\"", "Pros: Features\n\nCons: Factory settings require tweeking to get good pictures\n\nExcellent phone for the price. Always shop around because even though it was priced at 249.99, I got a price match to 149.99 at best buy mobile. This phone's factory settings are not good for camera operation. You have to switch the resolution in order to get the anti-shake feature to turn on. Once that is set-up, no worries and it produced very good pictures. I am very pleased with this phone and would recommend it to anyone looking for a modern smart phone. One thing to consider is that the Samsung S3 can essentially do all the same things as this phone minus a couple of small features that I will probably never use(use front and rear camera simultaneously.) The differences are really hardware as the S4 has a faster more powerful processor and more memory. My wife got the Samsung S3 free with a 2 year contract. If I knew then what i know now, I would have saved 149.99 and went with the free Samsung S3.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Resolution, Battery, Speed\n\nComparing to the S3 that I had for a year and a half prior to this, the S4 is so much better! The battery actually lasts the whole day! I would have to charge the S3 at least once, usually twice a day. It has taken a while to trust that the battery will last. It does. The screen resolution is another positive change with the S4. I use multiple email programs - for work and personal use. Best overall phone on the market today! BUY IT!!", "Pros: great speed handling data\n\nPhone a bit large but I like it still. Can still easily text and the large screen is great for watching short videos and checking emails. The camera has practically replaced my regular camera. I'm enjoying the phone without any real quirks yet.", "Pros: Android OS & Samsung hw\n\nCons: Size\n\nGreat phone. Nice screen size and resolution. Responsive browsing. Downside is phone is too big for one thumb operation. Thin metal bezel is easy to scratch/bend.

I fell inlove with the galaxy weh I got the S2. Now that I have the S4, I love it even more with it's upgrades. The camera is awesome, I can download whatever I need and it works very well on my phone. The only issues I'm having with it right now is that my screen jumps, ever so often, when I'm on it, and I can't set up my emails. But I heard that there is an update for the phone so maybe that is the issue. Evey phone has it's glitches, but hands down, I would pic the galaxy each time or any comatible android device.

But again my s2 was horrible with charge so this one is quite an upgrade.\nOverall I would defi recommend the s4.", "Pros: The price was good and the phone is just awesome\n\nCons: The battery life is short\n\nWell what can I say about this phone. Everything is just awesome and for the price it's all worth it. The screen is so good and it looks nice as well. This is by far the best phone I have ever bought.", "Pros: Camera alone is the best feature.\n\nCons: Battery life could have been better.\n\nOverall the Galaxy S4 is a very good. All applications are easy to use and you'll get no complains from me.", "Pros: Screen quality\n\nCons: Hard to answer the phone , not easy to make/receive calls\n\nThis seemed to one of the best on the market. I have shopped for phones for a while and I have had 3 to 4 different store's recomend the Galaxy 4. I am still getting use to all the bells and whistles. It seems to be easy to use on the Apps and when using the internet and camera. The only problem it is not as user friendley as a phone as I had hoped for. It can be hard to swipe the screen in order to answer the phone. I would also like to be able to tell when I have a voice mail easier then it shows. Overall I am glad that I selected this phone.", "Pros: its purple!\n\nCons: the motion apps are a little hard to work\n\nThis is the best phone I have ever owned. The picture quality is great in regular or low light. Im having trouble with working the motion apps. I dont think its the phone though. It looks good and sounds good. I can even use my printer crom the phone.", "Pros: Everyday use\n\nCons: Speaker\n\nI purchase this phone because it seemed very different to what I was using before and I'm really like it. It is very easy to learn the features and get used to it. My usage is average and the battery lasted two full days before charging, my minor complaint is the position of the speaker because sometimes I can't hear it even with the volume all the way up. It takes great pictures and pairs up well with Bluetooth.", "Pros: easy to use, has split screen for multitask\n\nmy first android touch screen became very familiar with it the first two days. wonderful apps and great sound quality.", "Pros: I can actually READ the screen\n\nCons: Nothing so far\n\nThis is my first cell phone.

The picture quality is excellent...better than my regular camera.", "Pros: easy to use, durable screen\n\nCons: Not sure yet....\n\nMy opinion one of the best phones out there, all depends on what you want.

I have always been an iphone user and I liked it but I needed something different and Galaxy was something I looked at. After lots of research and playing around I decided to purchase the galaxy s4. After using it for a week I looked up the reviews to see if anyone could answer my questions. No reviews had anything to say useful so I felt I should add a review for moms or people who are transferring from apple.

Awkward size makes it easy to hit touch buttons on bottom when reaching towrdss top of ph I ne", "Pros: ease of use\n\nCons: quality of product\n\nI have used Iphones since they came out and NEVER had a screen crack. I was convinced to purchase this phone because of it's size and features. One week after buying the phone, it started running hot, malfunctioning of several apps...camera for one. It shut down apps while in use... So it was replaced. 3 weeks after receiving the second phone, the screen cracked and the crack ran diagonally across the screen. It was not dropped or mishandled in any way. It was not \"squeezed\" and someone in BestBuy suggested... Just simply normal use. Carrying it in side pocked, not falling on it or leaning on it or.....whatever! Efforts to get this replaced were rejected.... Rudely accused of a number of things by Bestbuy and Samsung. And of course there is no help from AT&T.\nIn other words, I am stuck with a cracked phone that could cut my finger by using is in proper manner for 2 more years.....It is possible that having the Geek Squad insurance might have fixed it but am not even assured of that.

I like the big screen and picture quality. I've also been stepping through the many features of the phone, one-by-one, in order to set the phone up. Some are easier than others. The online manual is a big help. I also like the Android operating system. I can see that this phone will give me many years of good service.", "Pros: User Friendly, but with lots of options\n\nCons: No complaints\n\nI recently upgraded from the Samsung Galaxy S3 to the S4 and didn't expect there to be many 'extra' options; I was wrong. There is a great amount of security on this one. And the one thing I noticed that was a real time saver was they have the numbers on the same screen as the letters. I use numbers/letters interchangeably all the time, so it was a downfall for me on the S3 and super stoked they added this feature! Overall a great phone from battery life to ease of use!", "Pros: so many features and I can view stuff iphone cant\n\nCons: battery at first wasnt to great but after an update itll last through the day\n\nThis by far is one of the best phones ive had and it does everything iphone does and has just about every app iphone has. It can has music movies games apps. The fact I can go to 64 gb with out spending tons more money thanks to the sd card. And of course I got a bigger screen and not just an extra row is a plus. I like both phones but this is really better and if you havent been impressed with ios 7 and have never used android but are thinking about it, go for it. And you cant beat best buys phone protection I mean if I break it drop it submerge it, and as long as I bring it to them in no more than four pieces ill get another phone.", "Pros: Pairs with my Samsung LED TV\n\nCons: Installed ringtones are terrible, install your own\n\nIn general, I think its a great phone. iphone display is still too small for me. Good features, plenty of apps available and expandable memory", "Pros: its more than a phone-\n\nCons: pretty large\n\nThis phone is much more than just a phone. It is easy to get on the internet. The camera takes decent pictures. It is pretty large when you get a case on it.", "Pros: features\n\nCons: Haven't found anything yet\n\nLove the phone as I use to have the galaxy 2 which I loved very much until I purchased the 4. The graphics are fantastic and the screen color and size is better. Overall the phone's technology is really advanced.", "Pros: Absolutely everything\n\nCons: taking pictures CAN be awkward\n\nAfter having my Droid 3 for two years, I was ready to get a phone that was not just new, but the latest model. I was leery of having to use the touch screen for typing (I was spoiled by the Droids' keyboard) but I nabbed the Google keyboard app, and I have completely adjusted.\n\nThe phone is fast, reliable, has a great battery life despite HEAVY app/web use, and even the native speaker is good for audio.\n\nThe S4 is just amazing...", "Pros: almost a mini computer\n\nCons: not enough apps, and learning curve\n\nI miss my old qwerky keyboard, but like the speed and screen size of the is new phone. It still amazes me of the things that I can do with it, from faster email searching to faster internet search access. The learning curve is constant and it still needs more apps to compete with the fruitier phone. I like the screen size and everyday, another shortcut is found to make this worth keeping. I would like better zoom lens with the next model", "Pros: speed; camera quality; clarity; swipe feature; very cool features like a hearing test;\n\nCons: huge learning curve from iphone; too big; extremely short battery life;\n\nI returned it after 2 my two week trial period. Didn't feel like I had enough time to get used to it after after having an iphone for 3 or 4 yrs. The phone was too big to get used to. Great features but did not like having to charge it constantly and I don't use alot of apps or widgets. Had to remember to clear running programs throughout the day. Still may try another Android but will definitely want a smaller phone with longer battery life. Also didn't care for the boring gray color of the email page. The whole operating system was very frustrating. If carriers allotted 30 days vs 14 to try it out, I may have kept it.... except for the size and battery.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Picture quality and sound are great\n\nCons: Battery life and frequency of call dropping\n\nLove the phone in general but the battery life is suspect, especially when using Bluetooth and have never had so many calls drop - I use my bluetooth while driving and lose calls EVERYWHERE at ANYTIME even in places I drive by regularly , one day the call will drop, but I could have driven the same route for a month and nothing happened before WTH? - this is something that is not makiing me happy. Voice recognition, picture quality, camera, etc are all great but the lack of battery strength and the frequency of call drop take this from perfect 10 to an 8.", "Pros: This phone is easy to use and a slim design.\n\nCons: The touch screen is sensative .\n\nI replaced the HTC Evo 4G with this phone. The transition from the Evo to the S4 was easy and everything transferred from one to the other flawlessly.", "Pros: speed on net & screen quality\n\nCons: battery life could be better\n\nI went from an iPhone 4 to this phone and I have no regrets.

I would recommend this phone to anyone!", "Pros: Large screen\n\nCons: Plastic back plate gets slippery\n\nI preordered the phone back in April and never looked back. This has been a phenominal phone replacing my iPhone 4S.\n\nI'm not the biggest fan of TouchWiz but that was easily taken care of by installing my own launcher from the Google Play store. After that this phone has been the best phone I've owned until this date.\n\nCamera is great, it takes really sharp photos and captures a lot of detail.\n\nMy favorite part about the phone has to be the display, the sAMOLED 1080p screen is second to none, it shows such vibrant colors it's amazing really.\n\nIf I could take away something from all this is that the plastic back plate cover of the phone tends to get a little slippery from natural oils that get left behind by your fingers.

Easy to navigate, pretty tough, replaced my camera. Not a heavy texter like the kids. My son has one of the phones and can't seem to put it down. Maybe because they have more time than I do. I don't use it for business profession. The video quality is good on it. I use it for pictures when I am on vacation. I like how we can download and transfer to other places. It would be nice if it had a little printer to go with it. I also have the insurance but haven't had to use it yet. Thank God! I can Facebook and use it for internet access as well.

I get on the internet fast. Also, getting on the apps and using apps have been good. The camera is good and doesn't turn off my music when in use. There are some many you can do with this phone that I'm still learning on how and what it can do. My only problem is my signal is weak and sometimes can't send pictures though text. I haven't had dropped calls. Overall a great and fun phone.", "Pros: folders, app access, email\n\nCons: speaker phone quality\n\nSpeaker phone isn't the best quality but it works. Everything else is perfect and fits all my needs.", "Pros: The camera is really good and clear and I love all the different modes available. its sleek and fashionable\n\nCons: I often times have issues with sending mms. either it wont send or takes multiple tries to send.\n\nOverall a good phone. I love the look and feel of it. Also all of the hands free options are so convenient. The internet is fast and reliable as well.", "Pros: Lots of Features\n\nCons: Short Battery Life\n\nLove my new phone but the size makes it a bit cumbersome when being active. I bought an armband to hold my phone when riding but it makes it impossible to use the camera function (takes too long to retrieve it from holder). Otherwise, a good phone.", "Pros: Love the screen it looks incredible\n\nCons: wish the sound quality was better\n\nAfter having the phone for a few weeks it is great! This was an upgrade from my iPhone and I love the ability to customize nearly everything on the device. I do however wish it had better sounds with headphones and through the speaker", "Pros: Takes great pics & video\n\nCons: Short battery life\n\nThis is my 1st smartphone. Had bought Samsung tablet few months before so everything was similar. I do not consider myself a heavy user so the fact that I can't make it 24 hrs without charging is awful. I love the camera. The clarity of tv shows & movies is awesome! Would be 5 stars if not for battery.", "Pros: Good mix of features, good quality\n\nVery good device, great feature set without going overboard.\nBattery life is better than my Motorola droid razr, battery life better, and the 12 watt charger does the job quickly.\nReception is good, noise cancelling works well, and the 1080 screen is great.", "Pros: Great camera\n\nCons: no issues\n\nI have been very happy with the ease of use and all the features.

It handles all the normal activities (calling and texting) with no issues and has superior picture quality.", "Pros: Everything\n\nCons: Haven't found that yet\n\nI upgraded from the Motorola Bionic to this phone and so far it is phenomenal. I haven't really used any of the \"gimmicky\" features like the eye tracking and whatnot. But the speed (even though my last phone was 4GLTE too) and battery life of this thing are amazing.\n\nEven about a month into owning this phone I'm still getting anywhere from 18-28 hours on a single charge with moderate use during the day. The screen is nice and crisp, and so far I've found transitioning from the Motorola interface to the Samsung interface to be pretty painless. I probably would have stuck with Motorola had they actually released something new more than once every 18 months or so, but now I don't know if I'd switch back, this Samsung is very nice. About my only complaint would be having to go to Verizon's ultra junk \"share you wallet\" data plan from my unlimited plan. I was upgrading 2 phones and buying two at full retail just wasn't in the cards.

Take pictures, play videos, access emails, send/receive calls, play games, plus it has the touch and share feature to send data directly to another phone of its kind (which I my wife has). The only thing that knocks it down a from a 5 star rating is that the battery gets warm (not hot) when playing games or videos.", "Pros: You can do just everything\n\nCons: Nothing so far, other than learning Android speak (former Apple user)\n\nGreat product. Got a great deal with the $50 Gift card. I really like the camera feature and expandable memory. Took a while to get used, but I am happy with it now. Call quality has been a little bit of an issue, but not enough to impact how much I like the new phone.", "Pros: Camera, openness, speakers, sound\n\nCons: Complicated at first, battery life sometimes iffy\n\nI was an avid iphone user.

I would definitely recommend this phone.", "Pros: Reasonably priced, good camera, battery life is excellent and the watchon remote.\n\nCons: As with most smartphones, the bloatware.\n\nI love this device. It has controls to save power, is very user friendly, has excellent battery life considering the size of the screen and the voice control for the camera is awesome.\n\nWithout the voice control for the camera, it is difficult to take a picture. NFC and SBeam is cool as well. The ability to mirror your screen via wireless (with dongle that costs extra) or via wire is awesome.", "Pros: I love the driving mode\n\nCons: I cannot get the air-gestures to work alot of the time\n\nThis phone has been wonderful. I love the screen size and quality. The battery seems to last pretty long for as many features as it does. I haven't gotten the air-gestures to work right. There are so many neat things this phone does, but I haven't had time to learn them all yet. I also love the swipe to text.", "Pros: Features\n\nCons: Not a pocket phone\n\nAmazing phone, but let me encourage you to either obsessively protect the device, or buy the insurance. I've known two people that broke their screens in the first week by carrying the phone in their pockets. For you aggressive phone users, buy a case, buy a screen protector, and BUY THE INSURANCE. Other than that, you won't be disappointed.", "Being king of the Androids isn't saying much. Android OS is the least intuitive OS on the market right now imo, with some of the worst 3rd party integrations with supporting products and software I've seen. The phones are filled with bloatware from Samsung and the carrier, and you can't even upgrade your software without a wait for months by random lottery (a major security concern). The speaker is horrific, but about on par with other phones these days. The screen is huge, which could be a benefit if you can't afford to own a tablet, else it's total overkill and will cause you loads of battery issues.

Best Buy salespeople were very helpful, especially the Samsung specialist.(I've gone back to ask several questions.) I'm really enjoying the 5\" screen and ease of calling and texting. The camera is the best I've owned! Getting a wireless router from Best Buy the following week helps with data usage. Expect to charge almost daily.", "Cons: Everything\n\nI can't believe I have to watch tons of videos to understand how to use my new phone. Not remotely intuitive, unlike my former iPhone. I wanted the larger Galaxy in part because I wanted the typing to be easier with a bigger keyboard but in fact it's way worse than my iPhone. I can't type one word on it without a typo, which is why, I'm guessing that there are 3 choices for the right word that pop up at the bottom of the screen. Samsung knows how bad the keypad is!\n\nSometimes I can touch the screen -- a button or an arrow -- and nothing happens. I can press it repeatedly and get no reaction from the phone. Other times, if my finger even hovers over something, the phone reacts as if I've pressed it when I haven't. So it's always suddenly flying off to some other app or whatnot, some place I didn't want to go. The side \"off\" button is in the worst location possible and I'm constantly accidentally turning the phone off. It drives me crazy.\n\nAlso, it is ridiculous the amount of things Samsung has installed automatically -- apps and stuff -- that I don't want but are hogging all my memory. I have 1/2 the number of apps, music, and podcasts on my Galaxy that I had on my iPhone (which had the same amount of memory), and I am constantly getting messages on my phone that I\"m out of space and basic functions aren't going to function properly. Why is there a factory-installed NFL app on my phone that I didn't ask for taking up space? There are a ton of things automatically installed that I can't get rid of that I don't want. I've had the phone a month. It's totally ridiculous that I'm getting messages that I'm out of space. This angers me off no end. Who cares if I can take amazing pictures and do all kinds of things with the great camera if I don't actually have the space on my phone to take more than a few pix?!

Never did figure out how to transfer contacts, but I may have misunderstood the person explaining it to me. Just make sure you use some kind of backup assistant or Cloud feature to transfer contacts if you are not going to have them do it at the store.\nThe speaker itself is not to good, I miss a lot of calls, but using a good set of headphones it's a great music player as well.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Easy set up, decent price\n\nCons: Haven't learned to use the camera properly\n\nI have only had this phone for a month but I like it so far.

This was an upgrade from the Samsung Galaxy 3 and I am pleased with my purchase.", "Pros: it thinks for you\n\nCons: battery runs low quick if you run too many things\n\nThis is my first smart phone. I love the size and feel of it. This S4 does it all...GPS..Web navigation...talk commands.\nI love it and reccommend it for everyone", "Pros: It's a laptop, camera, radio, and phone -in-one in a smaller item to carry around.\n\nIt was easy to use the camera and almost have the same megapixel like my digital camera. Didn't need to use my other camera during my recent month vacation. It was easy to access my emails when internet was available where I went. It's nice that reminds me to connect to a wi-fi to save battery when available. Still figuring out all the features in which it will take me a while because I'm not advance in technology yet.", "Pros: camera and pictures\n\nCons: everything\n\nI decided to switch from iphone 5 to GS4. Worse mistake I've made. The phone is very slow on internet, calls and anything you want to do. Let's say you want to call someone you have to touch at least 5 key's in order to call. Then you have to charge the battery everyday, if you're lucky the phone makes it to the night. Then the keypad, it doesn't have an auto correct, if you typed wrong you gotta fix it your self, but the iphone5 you didn't have to. And even worse The phone hangs all the time. I'm waiting for iphone5 S to switch back.", "Pros: Easy to use, amazing screen quality\n\nCons: Short battery life\n\nI love this phone. It works great. The screen is amazing. The phone takes terrific pictures, the apps run smoothly. The only downside is the battery life. It sometimes doesn't last a full day (although I am a power user...lol)", "Pros: Size, screen, ease of use\n\nCons: Battery drains quickly\n\nIt's a great phone, switched from an iPhone 5 and have been happy making the change. Nice big screen, thin enough to feel comfortable sitting in pocket.\nBatter drains quick, but is most likely due to bad signal in center of building I work in.", "Pros: speed, coverage, camera, size\n\nCons: battery life\n\nI think this is the best camera phone thus far on the market. I really enjoy the call quality and download speeds. Multitasing is phenomonal when doing anything. I hope this phone lasts forever. I can't imagine anything being better, but there is always tomorrow.", "Pros: picture quality\n\nCons: short battery life\n\nI've wanted this phone since the 3 gen I saw, but the s4 is so much better all the cool features. Just an over all great phone, the coolest one on the market in my opinion.", "Pros: Easy to use, great camera, lots of options and add ons\n\nCons: Screen scratched already :(\n\nReluctantly switched to Galaxy S4 from iPhone and I love it! The possibilities with this device are endless. Love showing off the TV remote control capabilities and the facial recognition for the lock screen. The default keyboard wasn't great, but downloaded Google Keyboard and it works great. Love this phone!", "Pros: Easy to use. Great price.\n\nCons: Have not found a flaw yet.\n\nI have spent a lot of time using the phone, and I love everything about it. There are just so many features, that I feel that I could dive deeper and deeper and never use it all.", "Pros: versatility\n\nCons: When looking for an address the computer has difficulty decerning my words.\n\nI like the navigation feature. The camera seems adequate. The Best Buy support staff has been very professional in helping me. The texting is awkward for my large fingers.", "Pros: the size, camera and other features\n\nCons: battery could last longer!!\n\nI love my Galaxy S4!! I was so excited to get it and am not disappointed!! looking forward to taking a lot of pictures with it and use it on our trip!!", "Pros: The battery life is great. The speed and ease of use is equally as great!\n\nCons: I have no qualms about this product.\n\nGreat phone with many features! I absolutely love it! The camera is AWESOME! BEST PICTURES EVER!", "Pros: graphics, see screen better outside\n\nCons: 1 less bar than last phone and calls can be iffy.\n\nSmart phones are still phones, but, seems manufacturers are forgetting that. If I wanted just \"non-phone\" things to do I would have bought a pad or notebook. That's biggest beef, it's just not a good phone. However, everything else is really topnotch. Picture quality, taking or looking at, is quite stunning. Very clear. Actions are quicker than I have had before, very good.\nOverall, this is an excellent product...I just wish they would step up to the plate and put some dollars into their R & D on the actual phone capabilities.", "Pros: can do SO much more!\n\nCons: lacks simplicity of iphone\n\nThis phone does way more than I would ever use it for, but it is a great alternative to iphone. It has a lot of features and the camera is amazing. Picture quality and larger screen! I love it", "Pros: it does everything! phone to personal trainer and everything inbetween!\n\nCons: I havent figured that out yet.\n\nI love this phone. I no longer use any of my other computer/video stuff much anymore. easy to use. great phone/calendar/camera/personal assistant. it does it all.", "Pros: Camera and video features are really clear!\n\nCons: Haven't found a bad point yet. Still figuring all the gadgets out!\n\nNeeded to replace my Epic and it came down to the Note II and Galaxy S4. Chose the Galaxy S4 and don't regret it one bit. Wonderful phone that takes excellent pictures and has good video quality. Went to a jazz concert and could zoon in while I noticed other people had issues focusing with their cameras!", "Pros: The camera takes beautiful pictures. It's fast and has a lot of phone memory so one can download a lot of apps.\n\nCons: It's so sensative to the touch that sometimes it does something that I didn't mean for it to do.\n\nThis is really a fun gadget and very useful. It does so much that I'm sure I'll not be able to learn it all. I am having problems with the air gesture feature; it doesn't always work. I haven't figured out why and the voice control also seems to be hit and miss. But seeing that I'm still learning how to use it, I'm not going to say that those features are faulty yet. I was very surprised on how long the battery lasts compared to my last phone. I can listen to I Heart Radio all day and not drain it even half way.", "Pros: the screen is brilliant, the sound quality excellent\n\nCons: the battery seems to go quickly\n\nThis is a great phone! It's fast, has a brilliant screen, and excellent sound quality. The battery life is the only think which bugs me...but I keep a charger with me at all times..", "Pros: speed, screen and functionality\n\nCons: Doesn't clean my house.\n\nThis phone is the best on the market. Great speed, resolution and abilities. Must add micro SD card for additional storage.", "Pros: Easy to use, picture quality, speed, battery life\n\nThis phone is great for business or personal use. The sound quality is excellent with an amazing picture quality. I would highly recommend it.", "Pros: Everything\n\nCons: Nothing\n\nGreat features, even though I don't use even 1/4 of them.\n\nCall quality and signal are nice.\n\nAwesome screen, games look and play great.", "Pros: Speed, very good display.\n\nCons: Like all phones I've had you can't see it in the daylight.\n\nLove it. Voice commands and most hand gestures actually work. So far the battery life is good for all the time during the day I use the phone for email, internet search and calls. I charge the phone every other day. The large size has not been an issue.", "Pros: Awesome screen\n\nCons: Heat issues\n\nLot of gimicky features. Screen was awesome. Plastic case feels cheap. Gets too hot on long calls and when watching videos.", "Pros: Android allows so much customization with screens & apps. The camera is excellent, and seamless Bluetooth integration.\n\nCons: Don't care for the notifications screen, too much fussiness about it. Simple text or email notes would suit just fine!\n\nWow, did I ever labor over this decision. The iphone5 or this S4. In the end the screen size won out. Yes, android devices are customizable, and have just about as many app choices as an apple product, but the Apple products still work just a little bit faster and a little more reliably. This phone is superb, and most everyone will love it. My wife picked up the Galaxy Note II and she loves it! The excitement associated with these new Samsung products is addictive, where the Apple products haven't been so groundbreaking in recent years. So there it is......\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: great screen, amazing camera, fast processor, easy to use\n\nCons: nothing that I don't like\n\nUpgraded from the 3s! Totally worth it! The camera is awesome! I love the new features with using both cameras at the same time! It just works so much better than the s3. Amazing phone!!", "Pros: Many apps; great picture quality\n\nCons: battery life\n\nI love this phone. You must remember to charge it because all of the features suck up a lot of juice.", "Pros: What's not to like!\n\nCons: It was a gift for my son\n\nThe camera on this phone is incredible. It has better sound quality than my phone and it's got some pretty cool bells and whistles - no hands functions are pretty amazing. I got this as a graduation gift for my son and he snickers now when he holds my in his hand. Yes, the Galaxy S4 is a much larger phone and if holding a large phone does not bother you one bit, then it is definitely the phone to get.", "Pros: Good battery life. Fast quad processor. Big screen.\n\nCons: eye tracking doesn't work well\n\nI've had this phone for a month. It's been great. Big improvement over my 2 year old Droid Bionic. It's much faster to open and run apps. The interface is improved too. Android 4.2.2 vs. 4.1, I think. The screen goes almost to the edge of the phone. Makes my Bionic look dated the way old laptops with a big bezel look dated. I compared it to a coworkers S3 and the exterior is no big, yet they've squeezed a significantly bigger screen in (the S3 looks a little dated too with the wasted space around the screen).\nThe only complaints I have so far is that the eye tracking doesn't work that great. It's supposed to know when I'm looking at it and keep the screen on, but this doesn't wor ...\nexpand \u00bb", "Pros: Easy to use. .. great price. . Great pics. ..

Since I did I can't put it down!#", "Pros: Speed, capability, battery life, size, weight, screen.\n\nCons: Why the hardware buttons?\n\nI came from an iDont 5 and I must say, this phone is incredible. It allows me to do everything and anything. The screen is awesome, no lag in apps, LTE rocks, and the battery life (for an android phone) is impressive! But why samsung, WHY the hardware buttons!?! It's not what Google wants it to be! Quit trying to emulate crApple!", "Pros: great features, great software, camera is excellent\n\nCons: nothing\n\nI have owned an iphone and Motorola droid products...this Samsung blow them away. The phones camera is excellent. The HD screen is amazing. The android software and festures make this phone fun to use. The hand gestures are a cool feature. I would recommend this product to anyone.", "Pros: Ease of use, screen, camera, speed\n\nCons: Wifi indicator won't go away from notification screen.\n\nFirst Samsung phone I've owned (have had HTC and Motorola previously). This is light years ahead of both. Phone is easy, screen is amazing, build is comparable, no real issues. My one complaint for the Verizon version would be the Wifi indicator doesn't go away from your notification screen. Every time you pull down your notification bar, you will see it. Annoying but it doesn't effect the use of the phone. Camera is the best I've seen on a phone, video too.", "Pros: OS smooth, intuitive. Great features, Screen, Battery life, Reception,..\n\nCons: Camera doesnt seem to take pictures as well out of the box compare the S3\n\nBefore this phnoe I had an HTC Thunderbolt that was a great sturdy phone, but had seen better days. This phone plus Verizon coverage has meet all my expectations. I have large hands so the screen size is great. the scrren si beautiful even with a scratch guard. Im used to HTC android OS, but the S4 is very intuitive. It seems to learn what I want to do and ask questions and adjust along the way. Overall I would recommend this to anyone. My friend had an iphone 4. when I let her play with it she was like WoW! my phone does do that, and the screen is so clear. My gf's mother had the same reaction to the phone. The only thing I can say about the phone is the weight and feel of the phone out of the box its very light and plasticy. Buying a case for this phone is a must, to have a good grip, good weight, and protect this thin phone.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Lighter, thinner, better battery life\n\nCons: USB port/charger placement\n\nWas using an HTC Thunderbolt. Great upgrade, able to swap in my 32 GB Mico SD card making transferring all my information very easy. Speed is great, phone quality is much better than HTC. If you are looking for an upgrade a great alternative for an IPhone. Bigger screen, and able to increase memory, and replace the battery. Not a fan of where the usb/charging port location. Should be on the side or the top of the phone. Cumbersome to use while charging. One wish would have been to have a built in pad charger into the unit. Very happy with the phone while taking the upgrade discount.", "Pros: Screen, battery life. camera and just about everything..\n\nCons: Not much\n\nThis phone has done everything I could want it to do. The screen is beautiful. I replaced a droid bionic with an extended battery. Normal use with that phone I was at 20% battery left at the end of the day. Normal use with this phone I have 45% left. . The canmer is beautiful and fun to play with the features it has. If I had to say something negative the screen is so big but the actually phone size is not much bigger then other phones I sometimes activate apps when I was trying to just handle the phone. Other then that I was trying to choose between an Iphone the HTC one and this. After using all 3 i know I made the right choice.

Battery life is good.", "Pros: Full HD With Beautiful Color In Every Way Used\n\nCons: Can Be A Little Slippery, so can drop easily.\n\nThis is by far the best of all Samsung Phones. This is very light weight and looks sleek, professional, and classy. It has an unbelievable long lasting battery life regardless of using browser or multiple long phone calls. The price is great whether it may seem expensive to some, it is definitely well worth every cent and will be completely satisfied with their purchase.", "Pros: New Features\n\nCons: Battery life\n\nI love my new phone but there are puts and takes. I was intrigued by the new feature that racks your eyes as you read to automatically scroll the screen. Well it doesn't really work that way. It tracks your head movement, so you have to tilt your head to scroll. The 12 mega pixel camera is not that automatic for excellent pictures. I am still trying to figure out what mode to put the camera in to get good pictures, My seem to be out of focus most of the time. I do love the apps and widgets provided or available in the store. If I had to do it over again, I would still buy this phone.", "Pros: Battery life is great\n\nCons: Speaker isn't very loud/clear\n\nI moved to the S4 from an HTC. Some things improved and others didn't. I like pretty much everything about the S4. Great picture, the battery is WAY better than my last phone.\n\nOnly downsides - alarm isn't as convenient as HTC. Speaker isn't very loud.\n\nOtherwise, I love this phone and I love seeing android and its supporters continue to innovate while Apple just releases the same thing over and over again.", "Pros: Nothing really\n\nI switched to the GS4 from the iPhone5 (which I hated) only to realize that all of the professional reviews of this phone have been completely overrated. The keyboard on the phone is flaky. This phone is supposed to have so much processing power; however, the transition between screens and within apps is equivalent to PC running Windows 98. I ended up turning off the 'bells and whistles' because they don't function correctly. This is truly a device where the commercials on TV using \"screen simulations\" is just that because the device does not function in anyway like the commercials.", "Pros: screen size, smart view/scroll, etc.\n\nCons: keyboard with switching 2 languages\n\nI love the features on this phone. Replacing my iPhone with this phone was well worth it.", "Pros: Easy to use, great features and fun to use\n\nCons: The price\n\nThis is by far the best phone I have owned. I had purchased the iPhone 5 and returned it within 2 days.

In my experience, Samsung and HTC phones are quite comparable - and with these two having such similar specs, it was hard to decide. I've had my share of phones from both brands; the Samsung phones may fain the appearance of \"cheap-ness\" but they have outlasted all the HTC phones that I have had. You can really beat up a Samsung (and I have). For some reason the HTC phones have been just dying on me for no reason after just over a year. The Samsung can get tossed across a parking lot and you wouldn't even notice.\nI did eventually decide on the S4, and here's why:\nIt's faster, not by much - they both have the same processor - but the S4 is clocked at 1.9 GHz\nIt's thinner - I like thinner, it's also lighter . I've had my share of bulky phones.\nIt's got a nicer screen - well, it's bigger and has less bezel.\nIt has a nicer camera - 13 Mega Pixels on the S4 beat out the 4 \"ultra pixels\" on the HTC One any day.\nFeatures - it has a lot of 'fun to mess around with' features.\nAccessories - I like the flip view case and the wireless charging and the health conscious accessories.\nBuild Quality - In my experience, Samsung phones have ALWAYS outlasted HTC phones.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: The Camera quality and all of the features!\n\nCons: I do not like backing this Samsung phone to Kies Software!\n\nThis phone, by far, has been the best phone i have ever had.

I would recommend it highly.", "Pros: camera, screen visibility, apps availability, battery life\n\nCons: finding infrequently used settings\n\nI bought this Galaxy S4 to upgrade from the old smartphone. Call quality is much better, Camera is excellent. It is light and easy to carry on a belt clip. There are tons of apps available from app stores.

As it was, I phoned Verizon after purchasing it and found out that Verizon does not have coverage at that location. However, I did believe that I could text to my family and keep in better contact with them by texting. That has worked very well.

I find the Galaxy S4 (and the Android OS behind it) to be far superior to the iPhone. Our project is pushing the envelope on the use of HTML5, including client-side storage, off-line web applications (indexedDB, Appcache, web workers, etc.) The technologies available on iPhone/iPads are close to 5 years out of date.\n\nI test our app on the S4, Nexus7, Asus 10\" tablets, iPads, and IPhones.

I do wish the battery life could be extended. It takes a lot of energy for this \"non techi\" to discover the many uses of this device.

Speed, Camera, Size, etc\n\nCons: Coming from and Basic phone the battery drains a lot quicker.\n\nThis is my first smartphone and I was a little worried about the size. I was afraid it would be too big. But it is perfect. Sits in my pocket perfectly. Love everything about it except for having to charge it every day unlike my previous basic phone which would last 3 days but that's a small price to pay considering all the other benefits.", "Pros: Bright screen, many features\n\nCons: Complex for a first time smart phone user.

Took it to Samsung desk and after 1.5 hours was told it was a hardware problem and to call customer service. Two long calls to customer service confirmed it was a hardware problem and I needed to return the phone for them to repair for 7-10 days. I asked that they send a new phone to Best Buy or my local Sprint store and I will swap this one out for a new one. That will not happen. I bought the best model phone that Samsung produces. They acknowledge the problem is theirs but they do not offer a replacement. I am expected to be without my business phone for 7-10 days after paying a premium for their top of the line product. The young lady I spoke with told me \"use it without the tilt function.\" I told her I paid for this function and she said send it in for repair. I am disappointed Samsung has this policy yet it was confirmed by two of their employees. I will never buy a Samsung product again. I am confident they don't care.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Long battery life, good price, great quality.\n\nCons: Phone is a little too intelligent\n\nGot the S4 for free when I started a new 2-yr contract with Sprint thru Best Buy Mobile. It is the Best phone ever. I love how long the battery lasts. I can turn on power save mode and it stays alive for 2 days. The only bad thing is that it turns things on based on what it thinks I want and I don't like that feature.", "Pros: Everything\n\nCons: The plastic back\n\nI absolutely love my S4 because of its big screen and fast processor. Samsung really did a nice job on this phone. The only thing that I would like to change about this phone is the quality of the back cover as it feels cheap and flimsy. Also the camera on this phone is spectacular.", "Pros: the camera is amazing\n\nCons: battery live is average\n\nI switched carriers to get this phone! Coming from an S2 its a great phone.

I love the bigger screen, the call clarity is awesome. Battery life is much better than my iphone. I like how thin the phone is but at the same time wide. I love that it comes in purple.

Easy to get her started!\n\nCons: The first two times she charged and used it, her battery was disappointing. Lost charge well before it should have.\n\nEasy to make this purchase online, pick it up in the store. Staff at Best Buy Mobile at the mall very friendly, but seemed they they were not as well versed in how Best Buy online operated, and perhaps could be better instructed.

First time I have clicked on a a pop-up ad, and I think that I'm glad that I did.", "Cons: Couldn't easily transfer my iTunes from iPhone\n\nPhone works well. Like the bigger screen. Easy to use.

Always a Mac and iPhone user, I resisted getting into Android. Even tried to upgrade to iPhone 5s but it would cost too much. This one on Cyber Monday became irresistible, and I am so glad. Using it has been fairly intuitive, since much is similar to the IOS, but I really enjoy being able to use Micro SD cards and exchange batteries.\n\nMy iPad Mini developed a crack and it would cost over $200 to fix, when the time comes to toss, I'm going to replace it with a Samsung tablet.", "Pros: Redesigned keyboard, easy to use, fast\n\nCons: Gmail app, no old phone ringtone\n\nThis is a great phone! I love the new keyboard where the numbers are on the same screen as the letters. The phone responds quickly and unlocks easily. I am not so pleased with the gmail app...can't delete multiple items at a time and each item has a ridiculous label on it. The ringtone selections don't include the \"old phone\". Got this phone on a Black Friday sale...bought online and picked up at the store after the BF madness was over, (the wait to get it in the store on BF was 3-1/2 hours!!!). Very happy with the buy online/pickup in store program.", "Pros: speedy\n\nCons: sound\n\nOverall a great phone for most uses. The phone is sturdy yet fairly light.

I like the big scrren. Its not small and not to big, just right. All the colors and graphics are nice and bright and clear. My ebay pages pop right up. Just love it. Also I am pretty clumsy and have dropped my phone several times and nothing has happended to it with the silicon phone cover I have on it. Very happy with phone.", "The second day we got the cell the screen was cracked, I went to best buy and because I didn't purchase a warranty they didn't even bother looking. I called samsung there warranty does not cover screen cracks. The phone didn't take any direct hit, was not thrown or something or dropped by mistake until know we don't know how it become like this.

Really I wonder how a phone could be so fragile.", "Pros: Love the size and voice to text feature.\n\nCons: Haven't found anything wrong with it.\n\nThe Samsung S 4 is an awesome easy to use phone.

I am happy with the battery life, too.", "Pros: Easy to use, good keyboard\n\nCons: User's guide is superficial, need to go online to find out more\n\nThe phone has all the extras and apps I need. The magnifying feature is terrific for reading small print and emails. Some of the body motion controls are fine if you are sitting still, but if you are walking while the phone is set to scroll to head movements the screen jumps around. I got it at Best Buy for $49 so I love it.", "Pros: Screen size is easy to read; easy to understand how to maneuver thru screens.\n\nCons: Haven't found a problem ...\n\nDiscussed the anticipated purchase of my first smart-phone with several people. (I had never even texted before this phone!) I liked the size of the screen (don't need to put on my glasses to read the screen); moving thru options is easy; still learning.

After waiting for my two year contract to expire, I renewed with this phone and I couldn't be happier. It's easy to use, and has a ton of features, some which even I haven't used yet! I've read plenty of reviews on it and for a smartphone, it actually has really nice battery life. Even in the reviews, I've seen it referred to as the \"iPhone Killer\". I'm an android guy and this is by far the best android phone I've every had. If apple wants to take back control, they really need to wow with the next device!", "Pros: The camera is phenominal\n\nCons: still can't get it to do the dishes\n\nthis phone does almost everything you ask it literally, the built in voice recognition software really make this phone hands free. you can ask it to search the web look up a contact play a song even email a picture. The picture quality is very impressive and the camera takes very impressive photos. there is no reason to own a point and shoot camera anymore. I would highly recommend this phone.", "Pros: Video and photo capabilities.\n\nCons: No problems to report.\n\nThe Samsung S4 for 2013 is an awesome smartphone. Just the right size, very clear video and photo screen display, and takes great photos.

The problem is that the glass breaks very easily and the phone rep. at local store is very far from being the sharpest knife in the Best Buy drawer. It took over 2 hours, once seated at the desk, to buy the darn phone. With all the frustration with her incompetence, we didn't think to ask about accessories and the rep. didn't breath a word about a protective case. As a result, a small bang on the corner of the case and the glass broke. For repair, it must be sent across the country to be fixed at a cost of $70-100.\nRepair glass/case is cheap BUT be SURE to watch video or read instructions for repair. \"...infrared thermometer...heat gun...\" are an indicator that most people should NOT attempt the repair.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: viewing screen is excellent\n\nCons: SkyDrive app does not work all the time\n\nThe Samsung 4 is a user friendly mobile phone which has so many options to customize for your preference.

The only problems I have with apps is that some of the apps aren't designed for it yet.\n\nThe only complaint I have so far is using some of the advanced features i.e. scrolling with me eyes and some of the voice activation features. These are only minor and I'm sure it is just a learning curve.", "Pros: Battery life\n\nCons: Sometimes the screen is too sensitive\n\nI was hesitant about upgrading to the Galaxy S4 because I was very content with the S3 but I took advantage of the trade in program at BestBuy and figured why not. Overall it's a minor upgrade from the S3 but the three things that I like the best is the battery life, camera, and the voice recognition for texting. My personal opinion, the battery life makes the upgrade well worth it.", "Pros: S Beam is awesome and easy to use\n\nCons: No complaints here\n\nI've only had the phone now for about a month, but I have absolutely no complaints. I traded in my iPhone 4s (small screen and poor camera) to the mack daddy Galaxy S4. Haven't had a problem at all.", "Pros: Great price, well built, best multitasking phone.\n\nCons: nothing\n\nAndroid phones are so competitive to the Apple products today. And in my opinion, this Samsung S4 has surpassed the IPhone. It has a bigger screen, multitasks, is maybe not a user friendly as an IPhone, but is more fun to use than the boring IPhone.", "Pros: Speed, battery life, call quality\n\nThis phone is great! The battery lasts over a day without charging, even while using it for games, Facebook and web browsing. Call clarity is also really good. The speed of the processor for the phone is phenomenal.", "Pros: Lots of features.\n\nCons: Camera is very average\n\nI've had the iphone 4s, the samsung note 2, the samsung S4 and a few other Android-based phones. I test-drove the Note 2 for a couple weeks, it was huge, obviously. I then switched to the S4 and found that I couldn't operate everything on it with one hand, so that removed my negative thought of the Note 2. Also, after hooking up my work exchange server, I found that lots of the functionality was lost, more so then on the Note 2. A few things that I really didnt like in comparison to the Note 2:\n- The Calendar app makes turning calendars on/off much more difficult. On the Note 2 it just took a couple clicks. On the S4 it took several. I do this often to switch between professional and various personal calendars.\n- The email app also was less efficient from a useability standpoint. I forget the specifics now, its been a while.\n\nOverall this is a good phone but I had to go back to the Note 2, mainly because I rarely actually use my phone as a phone. I use it to check email, surf the net, read articles/books, play games with my kids etc. The Note 2 was much better for my type of use.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: everything especially the battery life\n\nCons: I haven't found anything bad about the phone.\n\nGreat phone, great battery life, great picture quality. Have yet to find a flaw", "Pros: Huge screen, great hardware\n\nCons: Almost to big to fit in a pocket\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S4 is a great android device. So far it seems to have good battery life and the screen is bright and gorgeous. If you are looking for a good phone at a decent price this might be the one for you.", "Pros: the new features\n\nCons: the battery life is to short\n\nThis new g4 is a great phone, it has lots of new features and improvements. Its easy to use and has by far one of the best cameras.", "Pros: Camera is great!\n\nCons: Haven't found anything wrong yet.\n\nThe battery lasts all day even with data on! Very easy to use! Camera is great also! I am very happy that I bought one for me and my husband!", "Pros: Size is good. Takes mini sd cards.\n\nCons: Scrolling sometimes highlights things you don't want\n\nThe S4 is a decent phone and I haven't had any real issues with it yet. The internet connection is far superior than my 9630 with a good selection of apps already on the phone.", "Pros: Easy to navigate, large screen\n\nCons: Battery life could be better\n\nAll in all, I love this phone. I've had 3 different Galaxy phones, beginning with the Captivate, and all three have been great. The entire Galaxy line just keeps getting better and better!", "Pros: Large screen, powerful phone, easy to use, a lot of features\n\nCons: I pulled it out of my pocket about 2 weeks after I had it and the screen was cracked.Make sure you purchase the warranty\n\nThis phone has been awesome. I'm finding new things to do with it everyday. One feature that was a total surprise was it has a port that allows you to use it as a universal remote. The watch on app uses that port to control your tv and cable or satellite box. In my case I have Directv and it works perfectly with it. I'm really enjoying this phone.\n\nThe only thing I would caution about is how fragile it is. I had this phone in the Otterbox. It was in my pocket by itself with the screen facing my leg and I pulled it out after work one day and the screen was cracked. I would strongly recommend that you purchase the Geeksquad protection for it. Fortunately I had purchased that and they got me a replacement in just a couple of days.\n\nI definitely recommend this phone. You will enjoy using it everyday!\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: High def photos! Beautiful.\n\nCons: Phone Burns my ear when I talk longer than a few minutes.\n\nI decided to change phones from an iPhone 4S to the Galaxy S4 because of the beautiful pictures I had seen friends take with it. I also liked the idea of being able to expand the storage with an SD card. I thought I would like the size of the phone more than I actually do. It's a bit more awkward than I like and doesn't fit in the pocket of my purse very well. But the thing I am most disappointed with is that it burns my face when I'm on it for more than a few minutes and while I'm talking, a lot of different things start opening for no reason (world clock, blue tooth, and others apps and widgets.) I stopped in the store to ask someone why these apps keep opening up while I'm talking on the phone and the girl said that I'm holding my phone wrong. She said that I am not covering up the sensors that are located at the top of the phone. She said that I need to hold my phone closer to my ear, but my phone gets so hot that I can't hold it that close to my ear. Anyway. I now wish that I would have just waited for the iPhone 5S. Siri on the iPhones is so very much better than the sVoice on the Samsung. I now wish I would have waited to get the iPhone 5S and not wasted my upgrade on this phone.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Features and screen are amazing\n\nCons: Lots of features to master\n\nThe S4 is an amazing phone, my wife loves it and thinks its the best android phone she has even owned. The phone is lightning fast and has a ton of great features. It takes awesome pictures and has excellent battery life.", "Pros: all the features that iPhone technology doesn't have\n\nCons: short battery life, apps run continuously taking up performance space\n\nI recently switched from the iPhone, which I thought I would never do. I was actually there at Best Buy to upgrade to the iPhone 5 and visited the Samsung area. The rep from Samsung was very informative about the Galaxy S4 and did an overall comparison for me that was honest and pointed out the pros and cons of both phones. However, the Galaxy S4 won me over, despite my experience with the Android OS. I was very disappointed with the last two phones that I had had with the Android OS, thus the switch to the iPhone in the first place. I asked the Samsung rep all kinds of questions and bashed on the Android OS quite a bit, but despite my bias I made the switch and took a chance. I have had the phone for a couple of months now and glad I did take the chance. It's an excellent phone with LOTS of features that the iPhone just can't come close to in comparison. Android has definitely come a long way within the last 5 years! Downside, I don't have my iTunes anymore.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Display is awesome\n\nCons: Ringer sounds could be a little louder\n\nOverall the S4 is a great phone. I had to turn off the eye scrolling off, it was too annoying.", "Pros: Easier to use, easy to read, touch, etc.\n\nCons: The battery really doesn't last 14 hours as advertised\n\nI am so glad that I traded up to the S4! It is wonderful and does just about everything I wanted my EVO to do but wouldn't., The battery life sucks to the point that I am constantly having to carry around a wall plug and/or keep it plugged into the charger in my car. I get maybe 4 hours of use. BUT...regardless of that, I am very happy with the phone. It is the right size...any bigger and it would be far too bulky. I can't say enough positive things about this phone except that I am very happy and recommend all my friends get one soon!", "Pros: fast speeds when loading info\n\nThis a great phone I have not put it down since I got it. It has fast download speed. Takes great pics and stores everything so its easy to find. I also like the graphics the games have on the phone", "Pros: Size is good. Takes mini sd cards.\n\nCons: Scrolling sometimes highlights things you don't want\n\nThe S4 is a decent phone and I haven't had any real issues with it yet. The internet connection is far superior than my 9630 with a good selection of apps already on the phone.", "Pros: Great camera and lots of \"how do they do that\" features\n\nCons: Overloaded with Google apps and services\n\nSamsung nailed this one! The Galaxy S4 is an incredible phone and the term \"smartphone\" certainly applies in this case. The features are numerous, as well as unique, and just plain fun to use. The graphics are incredible and the rear facing camera is as impressive as most point-and-shoot cameras.", "The phone seemed great but stopped working after two weeks. Though I was still within my return period as a silver member. Deptford< NJ best buy member refused to exchange it. He took the battery and sim card out then put them back and the phone finally came back on. He then said it works fine and wouldn't exchange it. He also said that since I purchased the geek squad coverage not to worry if it happens again that they will give me a refurbished phone that would be new to me or a phone worth equal to or less than the current value of my phone at the time of service. Don't buy the geek squad coverage. It isn't worth it. Also beware your phone might stop working after 2 weeks for no reason.", "Pros: Good price, pretty, with lots of apps\n\nCons: Should come with more instructions for all the features\n\nIs very nice. There are things I cannot fine out how it worked. Like transferring pictures form the phone to my computer.", "Pros: everything\n\nCons: nothing so far and don't expect anything to change\n\nI decided to turn in my Apple 4s and try the Galaxy 4 by Samsung. I really like this phone. It syncs with my Samsung tablet easily, the screen is very easy to read and for those of us that may be a little older this is a fantastic feature. My son just traded up to a Apple 5 and now wants to purchase a Galaxy 4 after using mine for a while. He's 22 and\ndidn't think I would learn how to use the phone. Ha! Mom has skills :) and the phone is that easily learned.", "Pros: Big Screen\n\nCons: Takes a while to learn all the different bells and whistles\n\nI picked this phone because I had a Droid before and I liked the large size of this one. I would of loved to have the Samsung Active but my carrier doesn't offer it yet and I wasn't willing to change to the more expensive AT&T carrier. Phone has a great picture, is easy to read and nice clarity. I am not in love with the new android emotions over the ones on my old Droid X but I might find better yet.", "Pros: Speed, photo quality, supplied apps\n\nCons: Virtual keyboard is not forgiving for being off center on the keys; a stylus helps\n\nI replaced my Droid X with this Samsung S4. No regrets. (I did like my Droid ... it was just time to upgrade.)\n\nOne of my big issues with the Droid was the virtual keyboard and my constant battle trying to correctly spell words. My fingers are not very big but the small size of the keys (in vertical position) and their unforgiveness of my being even slightly off center caused me on-going frustration with misspelled words. I hoped with the larger screen that the S4 might relieve some of that frustration ... it didn't. BUT, I've learned to get around that frustration because the S4 has a great word anticipation/suggestion system which has really helped minimize the misspelled word issue. Also, the voice to text system is very accurate so I find myself often using that dictation system. And, I've started occasionally using a stylus when I'm typing emails and texts; it has been very helpful.\n\nNow, beyond that issue, I am very pleased with the overall quality and function of the S4. I am definitely pleased with the obvious increased speed of the S4 while working in apps ... bringing them up and moving between screens. Also, the increased speed is obvious when going on the internet.\n\nI am glad I decided to make the move to the S4.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Easy to use once you get use to the controls\n\nCons: The phone has shut off on me about 4 times in the last month for no reason.\n\nGreat phone to have. Easy to use and great camera. Good to watch movies on the go.", "Pros: Smooth scrolling, easy functioning, beautiful screen\n\nCons: Plastic back\n\nI was at Best Buy the other day looking to upgrade my phone. I have heard a lot about the Galaxy phones that were made by Samsung and did not know too much about them. I was greeted warmly by the Samsung representative there named Calvin and soon I was able to learn everything about the phones that were important to me.\n\nPacked with the latest technology and beautiful colors, the screen was vivid and crystal clear. Trust me, you can tell the difference between this high-end phone to other screens. I was unsure about the size of the phone but after a few days of playing with the phone, it becomes a non-issue. The price was initially a drawback but the phone's functionality and beautiful screen were too good to pass up.\n\nI couldn't believe how much you could do with a phone like this. Calvin showed me all the important features and also proceeded to help me set up my phone with everything I needed to have on it. I came in unsure with what to get but the rep made the entire process simple and easy for me.

I am very happy so far with the Samsung Galaxy S 4. The camera takes really great pictures, the speed while browsing on the internet is really fast, and the clarity of the screen and things viewed on it are amazing. The only thing I don't care for is the actual size of the phone. It doesn't fit in pockets very well, but atleast it will fit in my purse. But you need to have the bigger screen size to have a better viewing picture.", "Pros: everything\n\nCons: nothing\n\nThis is an awsome phone. Takes excelent pictures. Has remarkable features like wave to talk or the pausing of movies when you look away. It is had to believe a phone can do what this one can.", "Pros: size and simplicity\n\nCons: nothing so far\n\nLightweight and easy to set-up. Texting easier and camara is a great plus for mission trips and other church related events", "Pros: The dual camera\n\nCons: Short battery life.\n\nThis is my first smart phone. It has been really easy for me to learn how to use. My biggest complaint is that it keeps shutting down and I have to take the battery out and reboot it. So I will be taking it back to Best Buy and having the Geek Squad take a look at it. I have to charge the battery every day. Not used to doing that.

If I turn wifi off and then switch back on it will connect and work for a couple of minutes, but then stop loading anything and I get a no internet connection message from the webpage.

There was a learning curve but lots of places offering assistance, plenty of tutorials. The pictures are so great-I may do away with my camera. I found the cover I bought to just get in the way and took it off. Very happy with the phone. Verizon needs work, but that is another screen.", "Pros: Right Size, Battery Life, Features, Motion Sense\n\nCons: The Google Navigator in the 4.2.2 Upgrade is GARBAGE.\n\nThis phone was a HUGE upgrade from the Galaxy Nexus. I was accustomed to charging my phone 2-3 times a day, now I am getting 24+ hours of use - including youtube and internet browsing. The motion based features are terrific, and there is so much in the phone that it's like finding a new toy every few days as a new capability comes to light.\n\nThe eye movement commands are a bit of an adventure, since they sometimes scroll when I don't want their help. Additionally, the Google Navigator in the 4.2.2 upgrade is NOT as friendly or as accurate as the 4.2.1 version. Since it cannot be restored, it is the ONLY THING I would change. The eye stuff is a matter of adjustment, the Navigator is a Google screw up that they NEED to fix.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Big ScreeN\n\nCons: battery runs hot!!\n\nThe screen is great and has a great picture.

I was between an iPhone and the Galaxy S4, but I chose to stay with Google so the transfer from my Charge would be easy. I am so glad that I did, as it is awesome.

Great screen, great camera, 4-core processor, and lots of features.", "Pros: Runs all apps smoothly, call quality good\n\nCons: Average external speakers, bloatware\n\nI love android, and the Galaxy S4 runs Samsung's version smoothly. However, I would prefer stock Android with no bloatware. My only other complaint is the rear facing, tiny speakers. You have to crank the volume to watch video and hear audio at the same time without headphones.", "Pros: The camera, the screen. The speed of the phone. The amount of onboard storage.\n\nCons: Stock hard to get used to.\n\nBest phone I have ever purchased. I have been using smartphone since they were introduced.

I like that the screen is larger than the iphone and you have the option of putting more memory in the phone if you want to. The phone is very user friendly and I don't regret the switch for one minute.", "Pros: Tons of features and not too difficult to figure out\n\nThis is by far the best phone I have ever owned. For a smartphone, the battery life is the best of any I have owned. The phone has tons of features, so many in fact, I still don't believe I have seen them all. The eye tracking is the only thing that is so so as far as its operation goes. Otherwise, excellent choice if you are looking for a top notch, flagship smartphone.", "Pros: Great screen, easy Gmail and Outlook set up, good photos, easy to use\n\nCons: Battery better than my last Droid, but nothing special\n\nThe screen is big and beautiful and clear. The phone is awesome easy to use, and this phone is fast. Hooks up well to internet and takes nice pics. Siri is jealous.", "Pros: Just about everything\n\nCons: Eye recognition\n\nI jumped from the original Galaxy to the S4 so just about any upgrade would have been welcomed. Great alternative if you are not a fan of the IPhone. Takes great photos and video. Internet works great both on wi-fi and 4G. Eye recognition does not work as well as advertised.", "Pros: camera\n\nCons: battery life\n\nI love my new phone. The camera is fantastic and pictures are of great quality. I love how the phone knows what I'm looking for before I do. At first it was a little creepy, but it makes searches easier. I have an issue with the battery being dead by the end of the day though.", "Pros: Battery life, screen, everything\n\nCons: Nothing\n\nLove this phone.

The camera on the phone is the best I have ever seen on any phone.", "Pros: latest features\n\nCons: bugs. force crashes.\n\nBest buy is expensive. Here, let me write a review so I can make you more money. Phone is okay. Had the s3 and upgraded. Lots of bugs. Phone freezes, and I have to pull the battery. Things just aren't that Smith. Camera has cool features. Battery life gets eaten up fast even with Battery saving mode.", "Pros: Nice big screen\n\nOk this has got to be the best smart phone, this is an Iphone killer. It has a nice large sharp vibrant display. You can run multiple applications at once. It has facial recognition for all you biometric buffs. and the battery life is impressively long. Great camera what more can I say.", "Pros: Fun and easy to use. great features\n\nCons: I had to take the first one back\n\nWhen i purchased my S4 I picked it up the day of release for verizon. I loved everything about it -- only problem i had was that the camera was defective. I kept gettin an error message about the camera failing, with no good solution. I took it right back to BestBuy the next day and they traded it out. Ever since, my phone has been the best. I love the different camera modes-- and i love how fast and smooth it is.

I brought it back to Samsung Customer Service Center, the technician said the button was sensitive as normal. I showed him how in-sensitive that faulty button was, and he just didn\u2019t listen. We argued for 15 min (even a 2nd technician besides him said it\u2019s normal), then I had to ask the supervisor out to re-check my phone. The supervisor checked my phone and told the 2 staff that the button was not working properly for sure, and they then agreed to repair it for me.\nMy experience with Samsung Galaxy S4 is this: 1. This phone was faulty when it came out of factory, where was Samsung\u2019s quality control? 2.

There is not one thing that disappointed me. I would recommend this to anyone. The flexibility when compared to Iphones seems limitless. Put in a 64 gig micro sd and never worry about memory limits.", "Cons: Some glitches in the operating system\n\nOverall a very good phone but if I wasn't worried about the memory I would have bought a iPhone 5. The phone works okay but it seems like they tried to stuff too many gadgets on the phone without making sure they worked first. Just like a Microsoft product it works alright and there are some very good ideas here, it just would've been nice if they had worked the bugs out before they released the phone. The large screen works well although I have had this lock up or stutter several times. It probably sounds like I'm putting this phone down but I actually like it quite a bit. And unlike the iPhone I don't have to buy a more expensive phone to get more memory, I just add a larger SD card. I put a 32 G in from my last phone and still have plenty of room left and if I have any problems I can always add a 64G SD card. Unfortunately if you're a Verizon customer and don't want to spend the money on an iPhone this is probably the best your going to be able to get, for a little while until the next big thing comes along.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Doesn't crash like my old Bionic. Nice size and weight.\n\nCons: Battery could last longer. Takes awhile to get used to all the features.\n\nThis phone is a definite upgrade from the Bionic. I've had no crashing and everything seems to work as advertised. I like all of the new features except the smart scroll. It wants to go faster than I want it to go. The battery can barely make it through a whole day. I would definitely recommend this phone to my friends.", "Pros: The Camera, the picture screen & I loved the word anticipation\n\nCons: It's a very busy app wise phone NO Flash player\n\nI have had the phone for 2 months now & I learn something new everyday. I was and HTC lover, but this phone is supposed to work with my Tablet & Smart TV, I dont know how yet, but should be great when I do. I took pictures at my Nephews Graduation and the pictures & video were awesome. I suppose once I learn all this phone can do I will be even more amazed", "Pros: easy to use, most advanced phone\n\nCons: n/a\n\nSamsung GS4 is the best phone I have used. I've been an iPhone user for 7 years and I couldn't believe how easy the GS4 was to get familiar with. The camera is great and the video is excellent as well. The screen is the best in its class and I will never own any phone as long as Samsung continues this trend with the GS4. This phone purchased with Geek Squad Protection is the best purchase I have made in a long time!", "Pros: fast, crisp screen, long battery life\n\nI went from an iPhone to this phone and WOW it's a great change. This phone is very fast, great call quality, sound quality, everything. I really have no complaints!", "Pros: The gimmicks are cool, but not practical for the normal user.\n\nCons: Short battery life. Way too big.\n\nHonestly, don't waste your time. Dont get me wrong, this is a really nice phone, after having it for almost two weeks. Just too big and too gimmicky. Takes a while to get any the \"cool\" new features to work. Coming from a GS3 to the S4. IMO, not much changed. Little faster. Better screen. Not wowed. Exchange for HTC One.", "I recently upgraded to this phone from a droid x2. So far my only complaint which is typical of all the new smartphones is battery life. The phone fits well in my hand for texting and general use. The screen size is huge compared to my old phone which is nice for viewing emails and web pages. The phone is super fast compared to my old phone. As far as plastic vs a metal case the phone is just fine, I suppose these people would prefer to drive a car from the 70's also.", "Pros: Camera and all features.\n\nCons: Battery.\n\nI pre-ordered this one week before it was released, but didn't receive it until it was in the stores for ten days already! Very disappointed! It works good, more features than I'll ever use, but battery life isn't what I expected!", "Pros: Easy to use. Big screen\n\nMy experience with best buy has been an awesome one! This is the reason I keep, and will continue to, go there for all my mobile phone needs!", "Pros: Apps, Interface\n\nCons: Battery Life could be Better\n\nThis is my 2nd Samsung Smartphone. My 1st phone was the Google Nexus phone by Samsung and it was extremely reliable and durable. This phone is a great improvement over that. Battery life could have been optimized by Samsung", "Pros: Easy to use, new intuitive features\n\nCons: Accessories are a little pricy\n\nI have had a number of smart phones from Blackberry to Windows Mobile, an iPhone 3G but Android devices won my heart with all the features they have and the new ones they keep adding. The Galaxy S4 is no exception to this, many of the features that Samsung packed into this device you cannot get anywhere else. For example where many phones would rotate the screen based on gyroscopic orientation, this phone will check the orientation of your eyes. So if you are laying down and the phone thinks it is sideways it will still stay upright if you are holding it as such. Also it has a voice assistant that requires only voice to activate. Just say \"Hey Galaxy\" followed by what you want in pure English, you don't need to practically learn a new language to know what to say to find what you want. When you do buy this phone, call your best friend first and tell them they have some competition for the title.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Almost everthing.\n\nCons: 16gb storage.\n\nFirst, 2 minor complaints: only 16gb on-board storage, and it ate a SanDisk microSD card. Solution: don't install every app in the store! and, format the microSD card in the phone's settings, storage, first then load it up from your computer. Live and learn!\nThis phone is intuitive to use, for me. It makes clear and great calls, no dropped signals yet. As a media device, it beats my ipod touch all over!! Bigger screen, faster processors, more RAM add up to a fun time surfing the web, reading books, watching movies, playing games.", "Pros: Long battery life and very fast\n\nCons: Call quality isn't the greatest\n\nI don't know why anyone says that the battery life is anything less than fantastic...I am a pretty consistent user and It is averaging 24-29 hours per battery cycle. Also, the reviews about how people say it takes forever to charge could not be more wrong...I can go from 1% to fully charged in less than 2 hours. The phone is quick..there is some lag every once in a while but nothing to write home about. The camera is outstanding...I can get individual droplets of water in a waterfall with ease and it looks crystal clear. Some of the gestures and motions are hard to get to work but I didn't ge the phone so that i could scroll hands free....\n\nIf you want a case to go with it, ask best buy about the new blueish S4 case that just came in...it is the most fitting case I have ever seen and its pretty durable.\n\nThe one downside I have encountered is the USB mounting to a mac computer. They have gotten rid of the \"mass storage device\" option. I have had trouble getting my Mac to recognize the phone. Another little snippet of the Verizon version is that you can't go full circle with the home pages...on the T-Mobile and AT&T versions you can but the Verizon version, you can only go back and forth, not all the way around.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Good price, easy to use, great battery life\n\nCons: update problems, network stops working a lot\n\nI had trouble the first week after I did an automatic update. Took it in once to Best Buy and the Samsung \"specialist\" couldn't help me (what the heck?). Took it in a 2nd time (to return the dang thing) and they fixed the problem by calling Sprint tech support. I've had it for a little over a month and sometimes I lose network connection. It happens at random times, but mostly when I'm in a bad service area. When this happens I have to restart my phone. I'm not sure if it's the phone or the sprint network. Needless to say, it's annoying having to check my phone to see if it's connected to the network. Also, I can't send emails from my personal account.

Only problem I have is the short battery life", "Pros: Great features! Awesome price!(free), Nice Size\n\nCons: Nothing\n\nThis is one of the best smartphones I have ever owned! I have had Blackberries, Droids, and an iPhone4 in the past, and this is probably my favorite along with my Blackberry Storm(my first smartphone). I like the size, the features, the camera quality, and everything it can do, that you wouldn't expect a phone to do. I got the phone when Best Buy had a promo, giving them away. I'm glad I got it on it! I still would have paid the normal price for it if I would have had to. I have used this phone for about 3 months, because I wanted to get some good use out of it before I reviewed it. I can honestly say it is a great phone and it is worth getting!", "Pros: Easy to use and big screen.\n\nCons: Almost too touch sensitive.\n\nPhone is great!

Lots of options and capabilities that I'm not even aware of yet.", "Pros: great camera, tons of options, extra large screen, not too big\n\nCons: it could be a little louder\n\nlove the phone! it was recommended over the iphone and I now see why. Love the big screen, takes better quality pictures than my camera. I also use this phone for work and it works like a charm.", "Pros: Easy to stay connected with everything\n\nCons: wish there was a nice case to protect it in.\n\nGreat machine not the best \"phone\" . I hear my echo on this phone with almost every call...it's very annoying. I do love all the features..especially with camera.. I love that I could use out of country with no issue. Should have a better call quality though as this is a phone.", "Pros: Great price\n\nCons: Internet 4 GLTE....could be better.\n\nOverall a great choice and upgrade over galaxy 2....pleasantly satisfied with all features and services!", "Pros: Easy for her to use.\n\nCons: No complaints yet.\n\nMy granddaughter loves the easy use and very durable. Her apps all work fine and her games are easy to play on.", "I'm writing this review based on my parents feedback. In an effort to get them out of the 'flip phone' era, I purchased 2 of these touch screen phones for my parents who are retired. They were skeptical at first but now they are texting, listening to internet radio, and enjoying all the app options. What really made this purchase great was the Samsung kiosk and the product experts at the local Best Buy. They were patient, knowledgable and exceptionally passionate about helping them to 'love' their new phones. The fact Samsung offers weekly training classes for users (for free) is an excellent way to give Samsung users 'real' support and enhance their experience with the brand. Kudos to Samsung and Best Buy for partnering together! This is why I continue to do business with both brands!", "Pros: Multi action picture taking\n\nCons: Nothing so far\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S4 is a great cell.

Battery life is much better than my prior phone.", "Pros: It takes better pictures than my digital camera\n\nCons: A bit large\n\nI am rather new at cell phones but so far, this one has done everything I want it to and done it well. The quality of the pictures is astounding.

Everyone that has one seems to love them.", "Pros: Fast and great OS\n\nCons: Camera could be better\n\nthis phone is great. Fast and able to perform all tasks I need it to. Camera is only shortcoming. Take blurry pics alot.", "Pros: ease of use\n\nCons: the home button and back arrow is to sensitive\n\nThe Galaxy s4 is a really great phone. Easy to use. Just a bit to sensitive on the menu and back arrow button on the bottom of the phone. Other then that I'm very happy to have switched from the iPhone to the galaxy s4.", "Pros: picture\n\nCons: adjustment period\n\nI have had an iphone my previous three phones. I replaced my 4s with the Samsung S4. There was definitely an adjustment period. The first week I hated it. I couldn't find anything, wasn't used to android, it's seemed overly large. I have had it for two weeks now and I still sometimes have a hard time figuring things out, but the picture is much better when watching movies and the Internet is very fast. I also love that I can control even my uverse box with my phone which is useful when I lose the remotes! I'm overall satisfied with the switch.. but will say the batter life sucks and there is still a few things I cannot figure out. If you are an iphone user and are worried about your music don't be I literally put in sd card into laptop copied all my music into a folder on desktop saved it to sd card and put card in my phone and there was all my music.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: i love that it is light weight and easy to use\n\nCons: nothing\n\nI love this phone I use it for everyday use.

My problems are the short battery life", "Pros: Excellent screen definition, very fast processor\n\nCons: Too many pre-installed apps\n\nI had a Galaxy S 3 and bought the S4 for my wife. Now, I'm jealous, since this newer phone is much faster and the screen is amazing. The pre-installed apps just seem unnecessary. If they are that good, I'll install them, and keep them for my next upgraded phone.\n\nBest Buy Mobile transferred all my files and most of my apps. Since the old Nexus S was about dead, it took a while, but the customer service rep got it done. and in a timely fashion.", "Pros: Large screen\n\nCons: Battery life could always be better.\n\nSwitched from an iPhone to android. The learning curve is a little rough, but I really like the bigger screen. Anything to avoid using readers. So far I love it.", "Pros: The new S4 has so many gadgets, and keeps it's charge longer.\n\nCons: Glass breaks easily\n\nI love my new Samsung S4 phone!

Perfect size. No regrets!", "Pros: Powerful, good sound quality, great pictures during daylight\n\nCons: night shots lacking\n\nPurchased two S4s one takes great shots easily, the other takes lesser quality shots, just harder to keep from blurring.

I upgraded from the galaxy s 2. So far I have not had a single problem with this phone. The battery life is the best compared to any phone I've ever owned.

I would definitely recommend this phone!!", "Pros: Many new features.\n\nCons: Short Battery life\n\nI was an Iphone user for a few years and decided to switch to the Galaxy after seeing a few friends with theirs.

Purchasing a longer lasting battery on day one seems a bit silly.", "Pros: voice commands\n\nCons: bigger then what she was used to.\n\nShe loves her new phone. The voice commands and voice to text & text to speech help her keep her eyes on the road. My personal pet peeve. A little too big for her hand but she is coping well.", "Pros: Sturdy build, very customizable, loads of features\n\nLove the way more new apps are taking advantage of the phones's sensors.

That is my only complaint other than that the phone is awesome.", "Pros: Battery live really lasts all day\n\nThe Galaxy S4 has been a great upgrade from my Droid Bionic. The best thing is the battery life. I am playing games on the phone and texting constantly and my battery charge still lasts over 12 hours.

Apple provided classes on the iPhone - why doesn't Samsung. I had to sen it back to the factory to get it repaired before 30 days of use. It would not charge.", "All in all, I love it.

You can't really tell when it's on speaker unless you connect it to outer speakers.Love it though!", "Pros: Great price.\n\nCons: No complaints yet.\n\nImprovement over my old S3, which I loved. Easier keyboard to type with since the numbers are now included with letters. No need to switch between letter and number keyboards.", "Pros: sharp looking screen\n\nCons: N/A\n\nJust buy it.

The ease of use and speed of the processor make this phone very nice. I use it primarily for business, and I travel quite a bit so I needed a workhorse and got one.\n\nI just wish the battery was a little better, but I installed Juice Defender and that should help.", "Pros: Ease of use and lots of options\n\nCons: Battery life could be better\n\nLove this phone! Wanted a phone that gave me a lot of options. This was it. I was debating between this and an IPhone . Don't regret choosing Galaxy S4", "Pros: easy to use and long battery life\n\nCons: learning all uses is taking a long time lol\n\nSo far I love everything about this phone. I upgraded from the s2 which is also a good phone.

It was a huge upgrade and still learning all the tircks of the new phone. Absolutely in love!", "Pros: LTE, camera\n\nCons: many built in apps that can't be removed\n\nThis Samsung Galaxy S4 is a great phone. The camera has many settings for all the different types of exposure needs for your photos.\nThe LTE gives you fast internet access while you are out and about throughout your town ( if it is covered yet ). My only complaint is you can't uninstall the samsung apps that are of no use to me.", "Pros: size, ease of use, call quality\n\nCons: Nothing yet\n\nMy second phone in this series... The best just got better.... Will continue to go with Samsung over apple", "Pros: Beautiful screen\n\nCons: Camera wont focus close up. Firmware problem?\n\nI switched from an iphone 4s and was fairly sceptical about the new os but after the first week and some customization i was thrilled with the results. Samsung makes a good phone, yhe screen is gorgeous. It feels lighter and therefore cheaper than an iphone but that doesnt seem to be holding true. Its fast and responsive.

Best Buy service was outstanding.", "Pros: screen, size, pictures, ease of use\n\nCons: battery life is less than desired, but average for an android\n\nI had the Galaxy s2 before this phone and the design is pretty much the same.

My daughter even uses it to write her quick school papers using the writing app.\n\nCons: Still a little confusing since switching from iPhone.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy s4 is an excellent phone and my first experience with Andriod.

We each use it for different things that work for our life style", "Pros: size\n\nI am still learning how to work my ph. There is so much I am sure the phone can do. I just need to take the time to learn how to work it. There is something that I got to be doing wrong because the battery is not worth cramp. Doesn't stay charge long at all. Other then that I am enjoying my ph.", "Pros: Easy to use n share\n\nCons: Phone is lg and hard to hold for pictures\n\nI like the phone. Just wish it was a bit smaller. Otherwise easy to use I'm a droid user, prior to this phone", "Pros: Larger screen\n\nCons: Almost too big.\n\nI use this phone while traveling the the states all the time. Had only two dropped calls in the three months that I've had it. Internet is fast and responsive. Wifi at home and mobile hot-spot when using with a laptop. The mobile hot-spot does not cost any extra. It just uses your phone data and there's no catch with the phone company. The bluetooth headset I have doesn't work as well with this phone like it did on my old one. Many people complaining of noise from my headset. The Samsung keyboard is so much better than the standard android keyboard. Battery life is good and can be replaced by the user if needed. Has a standard 8mm audio jack to plug into your stereo to play mp3s.", "Pros: Display\n\nCons: Texting is impossible, PDFs don't open, apps are distorted, sometimes slow, freezes frequently\n\nI miss my iPhone. There, I said it. Commence rotten tomato throwing now.\n\nI went for the Samsung Galaxy S4 because everyone kept telling me it was *better* than the iPhone, and with the gorgeous display I couldn't resist. I quickly realized how hard it is to use. I absolutely hate it. I hate everything about it. I'm tempted just to sell it for cash and get a flip phone for how absolutely useless this thing is to me. I've been trying to find someone to trade me for an iPhone 5 but I've had no luck. I've tried returning this awful device, but AT&T won't take it back. I'm very, very disappointed in this purchase.\n\nIf you love your iPhone, for God's sake, don't switch!!!! You will live in regret until your contract is finally up!\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Everything\n\nCons: Build quality could be more solid. Aluminum or magnesium would be great choices.\n\nNever thought I would like a phone as much as I like this one. Great (make that Awesome) display; lightweight; cool features; tons of accessories; and it works perfectly.", "Pros: Easy to use\n\nCons: Short battery life\n\nI like my new Galaxy IV phone. It has more bells and whistles than the iPhone 4S. However, it can be overwhelming to set up everything you can use on the phone.

I'm mad that I didn't make the switch earlier. I love the look and feel of the S4, plus all of the features it has.", "Pros: Got it at great price, camera, storage, feel/appearance\n\nCons: Probably battery life, but that depends on the phone usage\n\nIt came time for an upgrade and when we went to the local BB store, my wife liked the s4 over the iPhone 5 to upgrade from her old iPhone 3GS. Since the s4 has many great features and capabilities that others do not, like the camera, the AMOLED HD screen, 16gb storage, and apps, my wife really liked it and liked the appearance/feel of the s4 over the iPhone 5. It's only been about two months at this moment of having the phone and not much wrong to say about it. Since my wife uses it the most, she doesn't seem to have any issues so far, just some help in figuring out the settings and changing things to make it fit her style. Other than that, the Samsung tech support is really helpful if you ever call them for any issues or questions. Overall, great phone for the price we got it at and really beneficial.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: wifi calling\n\nThis phone has a lot of support, was very easy to root, and remove all the bloatware. Also a lot of custom roms for it. The battery life isn't so great though.", "Pros: battery life and features.\n\nCons: nothing!\n\nIt fits just right in my hand. The options of answering the phone and scroll without touching the phone are awesome because sometimes you have your hands dirty.\nI love this phone.", "Pros: Has a lot of features never seen before. Problem is they become gimmicky.\n\nCons: Love that screen is big but it takes time to get used to.\n\nI have had a lot of phones. I had for android the S3 as well as the note 2. I must say this was a nice improvement over them. I also always have an iPhone as well. For some reason I always gravitate back to my iPhone and this was no different. 2 week later I find myself using the S4 less and less.", "Pros: the voice input is the best I have had\n\nCons: The calendar feature does not have \"reminder\" as a default. You have to choose it.\n\nI updated from a Samsung Stratosphere so the S4 is a major improvement. I still think the battery power needs worked on because a phone should be good for a couple of days. This one doesn't make a full 24 hours unless you don't use it much.", "Pros: Everything\n\nCons: Build quality could be more solid.

Great (make that Awesome) display; lightweight; cool features; tons of accessories; and it works perfectly.", "Pros: Easy to set up and use\n\nCons: Battery life is pretty good but not great.\n\nI bought this to replace a Droid 2 and there is no comparison. It's like going from dial up to highspeed DSL.\nMy wife talked me into this and I hate to say it but she was right and I love it.", "Pros: High end specs, fast, works well with my in car hands free system\n\nCons: 4G can shorten battery life\n\nCame from a Galaxy Nexus and wasn't sure how I would like the Samsung skin on Jellybean but I really like it. Haven't felt the need to replace the launcher yet. Similar size to my nexus but with a bigger screen.", "My wife got an iPhone 5 when I got the Galaxy S3. I loved my phone, but she was disappointed in the iPhone (her previous phone was an Android). Got a great trade-in from Best Buy for the iPhone, so the phone ended up being free, even with the screen protector and case (and a couple of movies).", "Pros: Everything\n\nCons: Little low on the volumes\n\nSo glad I picked this phone over the other available options. This is one amazing phone. Possibilities are endless with this phone. Amazing picture quality. Highly recommended!!", "Pros: See above\n\nCons: Don't care for the eye thing, when you look at it and look away\n\nSome things are hard to figure out, but maybe it is just my age! It took me some time to figure out how to get the pictures off of the phone and on to my PC. I didn't have the proper software but I have it now so it's quick and easy. As is downloading my iTunes library to the phone!", "Pros: good camera, excellent sound quality\n\nCons: battery seems to drain quicker on some days. little fragile\n\nThis is a great phone with lots of new features. Especially compared to my old Samsung infuse. Haven't had the chance to try everything but so far I like all the new features. Was to big on scrolling email and web pages by tilting your head, but you can change it to tilt the phone to scroll, what I use, or turn the option off. Both cameras take realy good pictures. Still working with all the new options but so far so good. The sound quality is excellent. Phone calls and music are crystal clear especially after you set up the Adapt Sound. Just had 2 issues with the phone. One it seems to drain battery quicker some days, but just keep an eye on your running apps and wifi/blue tooth if your not using them turn them off. Two, phone with its plastic caseing seems a little fragile. My kid broke the screen on mines a week after I bought it. Luckily got the Best Buy insurance up front this time and they got me a replacement within 2 days. A case is highly recommended, I went with an Otter Box Defender. Takes away from the slimness of the phone but well worth it.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Expandable memory\n\nCons: Learning how to use the new phone\n\nI like that this phone is larger than the iPhone. The operating system and all its features are a breath of fresh air seeing as apple seems to have fallen behind. I like that it has expandable memory and I don't have to worry about not having enough space.\n\nAll around a great phone.", "Pros: Easy to navigate around the OS.\n\nCons: Battery seems to drain quicker than would be expected.\n\nA good smartphone for beginners that is easy to navigate around the OS for someone new to smartphones.", "I've tried a number of Android phones and nearly every iPhone iteration. I'm deeply integrated in the Apple ecosystem and have been for years. In fact, it would take a small miracle to find me using a non-Apple computer, now or at any point in the foreseeable future. That said, the transition to Android this time around was better than expected. My past experiences with Android were frustrating to say the least. Among my past Android phones were the Droid Incredible, Droid Pro, HTC Rezound, Droid RAZR, Samsung Galaxy S3,and Samsung Galaxy Note II. Until now I've always returned to iOS. I've tried a number of Android tablets as well and, until now with the Nexus 7 (2), I've returned to iOS every time as well. For me, it just worked. It was certainly boring, but it never failed me. With the S4, I can honestly say I will likely stay a while. All the extra gimmicky features are actually quite useful and I can see myself missing them on another device. Although there is an SD card slot, I do wish it came standard with 32gbs instead of 16. Otherwise, it's a great phone. Great work Samsung!\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: It does everything I need for business\n\nCons: Pricy\n\nI love the new Galaxy S4. It has all the features I need for my business and then some! Easy to learn, great quality.", "Pros: Easy to set up and use\n\nCons: Battery life is pretty good but not great.\n\nI bought this to replace a Droid 2 and there is no comparison. It's like going from dial up to highspeed DSL.\nMy wife talked me into this and I hate to say it but she was right and I love it.", "Pros: not much\n\nCons: camera is pretty good\n\nScreen cracked within 24 hrs. Found iut this was a common prob with Bestzbuy S4s. Return/replace process was PAINFUL.", "Pros: Touch screen is great. Love the big screen.\n\nCons: The battery life could be better.\n\nUpgraded from an iPhoine and love the Samsung. Bigger screen and more responsive touch screen.", "Pros: Much better than my Droid X\n\nI started out with the Droid X. Upgrading to this phone is a MUCH better improvement. I have a nice phone camera & a battery that lasts.\n\nI'm a photog & this phone has definitely improved my ability to take pictures on the fly, still actually looking great!\n\nGlad I used my upgrade for this phone!", "Pros: Graphics, Speed, relative ease of use\n\nCons: would like longer battery life\n\nI graduated from a \"dumb\" phone to this phone.\nI resisted getting a smart phone for two years.\nThis phone really surprised me with its capabilities.\nThe display is awesome , graphics are great.\nI like how easy it connects to Wi-Fi networks", "Love the Samsung phones & this one has definitely impressed me! It is very easy to use -- even for a first phone! I am finding this phone has so many options that will help with battery life. I would buy android as long as they put out good products like this one!", "Pros: Easy to use\n\nCons: Battery life could be better, but better than most.\n\nLove my new phone. It handles multiple apps without locking up like my previous phone. It is also very easy to use.", "Pros: Ultra fast and responsive.\n\nCons: Horrible battery life.\n\nThis phone is awesome with all its features, but the battery life is horrible. You have to disable a lot of apps to make it through the day and that's not including using the phone. If you get a battery expansion it works fine, but won't fit most cases", "Pros: Intuitive. The features are awesome.\n\nCons: Nothing\n\nThis is a great phone. Upgrade and you won't be sorry. The features are intuitive and easy to learn how to manipulate. I was an iPhone user and never thought I would switch. I was wrong.", "Pros: Easy to use. Great features.\n\nCons: Nothing so far.\n\nI have had an HTC, Motorola, & even an earlier version iPhone, the new Samsung 4 outshines all of them. Best phone I have ever had!!!", "Pros: Loved the apps\n\nCons: Battery life was awful, no reception in my office, poor call quality.\n\nI loved this phone but was not able to get calls or texts in my office. Battery only lasted half a day as it was trying to find a tower or something. Loved the apps but had to return to the Iphone as I get better call quality and not as many dropped calls.", "Pros: Besides the obvious, expandable storage and replaceable battery\n\nCons: Loses WiFi signal and login credentials constantly\n\nThis is a terrific phone with all the well known \"bells and whistles.\" The expandable storage and replaceable battery are key 'haves' for any phone purchase. One drawback: loses WiFi signal and login credentials constantly", "Pros: That phone is fast Ann's I get 4G almost everywhere. 6 weeks and no dropped calls.\n\nCons: The camera. Some features trashed good shots, but the regular camera is very grainy. My previous phone, HTC Rezound took\n\nOverall I like the phone. I got this phone as a replacement fleet my Rezound. If mp3 playback is your thing, this'd phone isn't for you.", "Pros: The features and capability.\n\nCons: The battery life.\n\nLove this phone. I've been waiting months for it. I have the Tab II as well. Samsung makes a very good product. Between the two of them, they are my primary sources of electronic communications and information.", "Pros: everything but the sound for phone\n\nCons: sound\n\ngood phone but sound for calls is still not up to par. someday samsung will get this right. This is my 3rd samsung phone so something is right.", "Pros: The size is perfect for me.\n\nCons: I wish the battery life was longer, but this phone surely out-surpasses my old one.\n\nI love my Samsung Galaxy S 4 phone. It's the right size and does everything I need it to do. Much easier to learn than my last Android. I would recommend it to anyone looking to replace their old Android phone. The battery life could be longer, but you know what they say... \"Give them a mile and they will just want more.\" :-)", "Pros: everything except cannot get 4G service from Sprint in my area\n\nCons: no 4G service from Sprint\n\nA 4G phone without 4G service from Sprint - bummer. Love the phone, disappointed in the Sprint service. Wish I would have known before I renewed a 2 year contract with Sprint.", "Pros: easy to use\n\nCons: not sure yet\n\nSwitched from iPhone 4s to this phone and I have no regrets. The phone is fast when on 4g LTE and has a good battery life so far.", "Pros: I used several Apps while on the phone. Perfect size for my hand. The phone is light in weight.\n\nCons: The battery could be extended.\n\nThis is an AWESOME phone. I used it for my business. It has all the bells and whistles I used for my business. This is a great phone if you are a road warrior... Yeah for Samsung - Galaxy S 4 Mobile.", "Pros: Easy to use. Great features.\n\nCons: Nothing so far.\n\nI have had an HTC, Motorola, & even an earlier version iPhone, the new Samsung 4 outshines all of them.

Battery only lasted half a day as it was trying to find a tower or something. Loved the apps but had to return to the Iphone as I get better call quality and not as many dropped calls.", "Pros: clear crisp pictures\n\nCons: a little complicated to get used to\n\noverall very good phone, camera and handles apps well. however a little complicated to use", "Pros: Easy to use, fast, great phone\n\nCons: A little large\n\nThis is a great phone. I prefer the android for all of the personalization and uses. I am a student and am able to get any and all information that I may need at a moments notice whether I am in school or on the go. Battery usually lasts the full day, a great improvement from my last phone.", "Pros: downloads quick and camera takes fantastic pictures\n\nCons: havent found anything wrong\n\nI owned the thunderbolt before this one and the samsung blows it away. Battery life is much better. The camera gets great pictures. No freezes so far and reliable.", "Pros: easy to use\n\nCons: signal in some places\n\ngreat phone but I notice it doesn't always work at my job. My old phone was a Htc one and it worked great at my job", "Pros: pictures are so clear. no need to take extra camera if you have galaxy s4\n\nCons: it really doesn't erase people in background\n\nI love my phone but still Samsung needs to do some changes on the settings to use hand gesture.", "Pros: Easy to use\n\nCons: Nothing yet\n\nFirst smart phone. Easier to use than expected. Battery life much better than expected. I get at least 4 days between charges.", "Fantastic phone! Samsung phones are quality products. They last for years. This phone gives me everything I need to be able to read and edit documents on the go, takes fantastic pictures and video, and works as an actual phone, too! Don't be a sheep and get an iPhone; check out what the S4 has to offer first.", "Pros: Camera\n\nCons: Operating system and navigation.\n\nThis phone is just not intuitive like the iPhone and I find myself more frustrated that I can't figure out how to do certain tasks more often than not. I loved all of the bells and whistles at first but once the novelty wore off I just miss my iPhone. The operating system also freezes or crashes often which is a pain the neck.", "Pros: Simple to use, full of features that I actually use.\n\nI use this phone more as a mini computer than as a phone. It's very fast. Very easy to use. Great camera. I'm using the S-Health pedometer to track steps. Have not noticed any issues with battery life -- last the whole day (6am - 11pm) under normal use, buit that is mostly texting and looking up info. It's a bit big but not heavy and I really like the large screen. I got the protective case and screen cover. Had them on my last phone and it looked like new when I traded it in after two years.", "Pros: Very capable of doing most everything that you could ask for.\n\nCons: You've got to be patient to learn how to use the features. Steep learning curve.\n\nSince I'm sort of geeky, I love the phone. It gives me all the options that were advertised, and many more. It does have a steep learning curve if you're going to use many of the features, calling one up in a given situation can be very involved, especially if it is a infrequently used/needed app.\nI'm quite happy with my purchase, I think the price vs. features value is great.", "Pros: Features, Powerful camera, S Voice, thin with large vivid screen\n\nCons: Battery life, Verizon model has removed some things....see review\n\nGreat phone although Verizon model has some features missing that are available in all other models including at&t's version.... Samsung introduced a settings screen called toggles to quickly turn on/off settings. Unfortunately the Verizon model removed a few of these included the Wi-Fi toggle. You can still turn on/off wifi in the regular settings but this makes it harder to monitor if you are still on Wi-Fi or not which may result in overages. 3rd-party wifi toggles downloaded from the app store are blocked from working as well.", "Pros: Easy to use\n\nCons: The battery life\n\nLike the phone. The weakest part is the battery life. Getting a compleat manual with the phone would be nice. I am a hands on person. Still learning about the phone and what it can do but overall I am satisfied with the phone and what it can do.", "Pros: Smooth operating system is truely a mini computer\n\nThis is the first phone I've had with web browsing. This phone can do anything and has the best camera on the markey", "I'm having a little difficulty getting use to it after having the iPhone for a while. Miss iTunes. The guy at best buy store messed up and downloaded music from iPhone and it went to my photos so i had to return to store and he had a hard time, didn't know what he was doing and the music is stored but without names of each song and no albums just the long code numbers. that is so wrong. It is a pain but other than that i like it. Well the price was too much and i don't like having to contract for 2 years.", "Pros: love the camera features. Will most likely love all the features once I figure them all out.\n\nCons: Had some issues at first buy resetting to the factory setting solved them\n\nThis phone has way more features then I know what to do with. It will take me awhile to figure out most of them. I basically went with it because I owned a Samsung prior to this one and thought it would be easier to adapt to. I was also sold on the camera features.", "Pros: love the interface, camera, apps, and the phone itself !\n\nCons: nothing as of right now.\n\nOverall AMAZING phone. Never going back to iphones or blackberry. I recommend this phone to any age or anyone with little to no experience with smartphones ! Very easy interface and amazing picture/video quality ! Love love love this phone :-)", "Pros: The value for all of the great features. Excellent phone!\n\nCons: No problems as of yet.\n\nThe phone for the price was excellent. I had an S3 which is almost identical. Love all Samsung products.", "Pros: Easy to use, fun apps, its able to do some pretty amazing things.\n\nCons: Battery life... Not so good.\n\nLove my Galaxy s4, cant see me changing phones anytime soon. If ido it would be to the s5. Does everything I want it to and more.", "Pros: The phone has a lot of nice functions\n\nCons: Tends to run slow when using 2 apps\n\nOverall this is a great upgrade from my Samsung Galaxy S2. The new features are extremely useful and provide me with more things to save and do on my phone. The camera is amazing and I pretty much only use that for pictures (don't use my camera anymore).\n\nI did have an issue with the LCD screen after only having it for 31 days but I went to the Sprint store and it was replaced.", "Pros: Processing power, reception, battery life\n\nCons: cost\n\nI previously had the Galaxy Nexus, which was a good phone, but the configuration (screen, radio, and processor) absolutely devoured the battery. I upgraded to the extended battery, and got some relief but not much.\n\nAfter reading the reviews for the S4 I couldn't wait to get it. I finally decided to pay full price, even though my two years wasn't up yet. The initial capital outlay was high, but I have absolutely no regrets. This is just a superb smartphone.", "Pros: The camera is amazing!\n\nCons: The battery dies really fast.\n\nThe camera is amazing! I love taking pictures of my gardens; flowers, vegetables, fruit, birds and insects. The quality is really great, and the zoom is unbelievable. I have a picture of a honey bee on a Bachelor Button flower and I can see the reflection of the leaves in the bees eyes, and the individual pollen grains in his fur, and on the flower. The battery however, is the only disappointment I have had. I charge it all night and then its still almost dead by 6 PM.", "Pros: My favorite thing is the camera\n\nCons: Nothing yet!\n\nI am switching from the iPhone to this and I couldn't be happier.. I love that my apps are the same and I get a a awesome camera ! I like I don't have to pay for ring tones ect..", "Pros: Easy to set up, great battery life!\n\nCons: Nothing\n\nThis phone is incredible. Easy to use, easy to navigate! The battery life is twice as long as my DROID RAZR!", "Pros: Battery life, app management, resource utilization\n\nThis phone really does make life easier. Samsung has definitely perfected the phone market where Apple failed at. The operating system is easy, functional and smooth. There are advanced settings and apps, but even navigating those are simple. It's the perfect size between too small of screen to see too much and the massive impossible to justify Galaxy Note. The battery life is easily managed and can do advanced functions far further than the competition.", "Pros: Easy to use\n\nCons: Battery Life seems a bit lacking\n\nGreat phone, easy to use, best droid I've owned so far. Though the battery life is better than past droids I've owned, I still would like one that wouldn't die in less than a day with minimal use.", "Pros: The picture quality\n\nCons: The battery\n\nI love the phone quality in picture and components. The only minor problem with the phone is the battery as it does not last long and when connected and in use does not gain percented but remains the same.", "I've had a G1, G2, MyTouch Slide, Droid 3, and Droid 4. This is the first Android I've had without a QWERTY physical keyboard. The phone is top of the line for a reason. The specs and second to none, and the IR \"remote control\" feature is great!", "Pros: Functionality & Fun to use\n\nCons: Battery life could always be better but i'm happy with it\n\nIf you want the best smartphone currently on the market...this is it. Highly customizable, resolution is incredible, 12MP camera and built in camera apps are the best you can buy for a phone as of this writing, processor is faster than any other phone I've used.\n\nThe only reason I gave the battery life 4 stars is because all phones have a short battery life. Although compared to my previous phone, this battery life is phenomenal.\n\nTip - look up all the ways you can use this phone instead of getting stuck doing the same things. Most likely there is a faster/easier way with this phone to navigate and do whatever you want to do.", "Pros: Fast Quad Processors, Long Battery Life\n\nCons: Voice Quality is Average\n\nThis is my second Android smart phone and is by far the best. The battery life is impressive and so are the quad processors onboard. You wont regret buying this one!", "Pros: good price and super lightweight\n\nCons: shuts off randomly\n\nWhen I first got the phone it was perfect and I loved it very much. After one week it had a malfunction because of the steam in the bathroom made it seem like it was water damage. Best buy was kind enough to honor the warranty but if I had to do it over I would go to Samsung and ask for a new phone instead of getting a refurbished one.", "Pros: everything\n\nCons: battery isnt the best unless all extra services are off.\n\nI love this phone I had the iphone 4 and felt very stuck having to pay for stuff that is free for android im not a person that enjoys jailbreaking so I didnt want to stay with iphone. Jennifer helped me at the rancho cucamonga store. She was very nice and the the time spent at best buy very pleasant. The features on this phone are immense compared to the outdated iphone that only sells their logo.", "Pros: easy to use and understand.\n\nCons: the battery life\n\nI recently switched from the Iphone 5 and it was worth the switch. I havent had any problems and love it!", "Pros: Easy to use, Best camera I've ever used.\n\nCons: Battery could last longer,\n\nI was going to buy the I Phone, but The salesman showed me the Samsung Galaxy S4, and I was so impressed with the camera thatI had to get it.", "Pros: size and speed\n\nCons: too many samsung and at&t apps forced on you.\n\nThe phone is great. It was easy to learn even coming from an apple phone. I have no complaints.", "Pros: I am so impressed with my new Samsung\n\nCons: Can't come up with anything at this moment.\n\nI have been an Apple freak from the get go. I have had an IPAD since they first came out. All Iphones and I own a MacBook Pro. I never wanted to change until I picked this phone up. I was sold right away. More for your money. Beautiful Pictures. Stunning videos. I was scared to switch and thought I was going to miss my iphone but i never looked back. As a matter of fact, i sold my ipad mini and went and bought the Note8. NO REGRETS! Apple just couldn't WOW me anymore not like Samsung. Not looking back!", "This is an excellent phone. the 8mp camera takes awesome pictures. The features that remove passer-bys from your digital pics is cool. The hands free option of waving your hand over the phone to answer and using your head movements to scroll web pages are some of the best features I've ever seen in a phone.", "Pros: lots of features and very fast\n\nCons: battery life could be a little better\n\nOver all a great phone. Had several samsung phones then went to an Iphone 5. Then switched back to my gs4! Cant believe I ever got rid of my samsung in the first place", "Pros: two cameras, screen quality and size\n\nCons: so far so good\n\nReplaced my Samsung Galaxy S (first model). Happy to have two cameras now for Skype. Larger size screen makes Kindle books easier to read. Wifi seems to connect easier.\n\nNothing negative so far.", "Pros: 13 megapixel camera\n\nThis phone is highly recommended and can do so much more than the iPhone. My favorite part about this phone is the 13 megapixel camera that it has, which is mainly why I bought this phone over the iPhone. Plus this phone has no many other features that you could use if you choose so. Thank you Samsung for putting out such a great product.", "Pros: Nothing\n\nCons: Made cheap\n\nGreat phone but if dropped it breaks on any impact. Cheap design compared to Motrola. I really thought that Samsung with there claims of Gorilla glass and sleak design would have been a little more durable. Broke the 1st time I dropped it and plan on long waits when you need to make a claim at Geek squad.", "Pros: A lot of new tech in the phone which make it a pleasure to use\n\nCons: Size is a bit big but i deal with that\n\nSuper happy about my new Samsung Galaxy. No regret switching from Iphone.", "Pros: ease of use\n\nCons: preloaded apps\n\nThis is my first smart phone, and I really like it. It is easy to learn as it has a help app etc. I like the larger size also. The only disappointment that I have is the preloaded apps that you cannot delete. I have never purchased a phone through Best Buy, and I was truly impressed with the service that I received. When it comes time for future purchases, I will come back to them.", "Pros: Taking pictures, texting feature.\n\nDid not realize what I was missing until I got the new Samsung S 4 and saw all the features and easier way of doing things.", "Pros: Easy to use, advanced in technology, good price\n\nThis phone is really technologically advanced. This is my first phone after leaving an iPhone and I am impressed. Give it a try at the Samsung Experience and I think you'll like it, too.", "Pros: Camera has a lot of editing features, long lasting battery\n\nCons: Haven't found anything wrong yet\n\nThe S4 is a great phone. I haven't found any problems with it yet. Clear bright screen and a camera that takes great pics. The camera also has a lot of editing features too. It is also very fast.", "Pros: Does everything I need my smartphone to do.\n\nCons: The battery life is a bit shorter than I'd hoped for, even with a lot of the built-in features turned off.\n\nThis phone is a decent upgrade from the S3. I am glad I purchased it.", "Pros: Battery life is amazing\n\nCons: Verizon/Samsung bloatware and annoyances\n\nComing from a Galaxy Nexus I was amazed by the battery life of the S4. I would estimate around 1% of the battery life per 2 hours of standby, but even with heavy use it'll get you through a day and a half to two days (with SynergyROM, and most Verizon/Samsung bloatware apps frozen or uninstalled with Titanium Backup Pro).\n\nThe screen is the perfect size and pretty tough; I've dropped it a few times with no issues.\n\nI love the option to use multiple windows at the same time rather than switching back and forth between apps, very convenient.\n\nI highly recommend this phone, so far only benefits with no problems.", "Pros: two cameras, screen quality and size\n\nCons: so far so good\n\nReplaced my Samsung Galaxy S (first model). Happy to have two cameras now for Skype. Larger size screen makes Kindle books easier to read. Wifi seems to connect easier.\n\nNothing negative so far.", "Pros: 13 megapixel camera\n\nThis phone is highly recommended and can do so much more than the iPhone. My favorite part about this phone is the 13 megapixel camera that it has, which is mainly why I bought this phone over the iPhone. Plus this phone has no many other features that you could use if you choose so. Thank you Samsung for putting out such a great product.", "Pros: Color and screen size\n\nCons: must talk directly into phone so they can hear you\n\nBattery life is great and no problems with my emails like my last phone. Never buy LG anything!", "Pros: Quick response and very thin\n\nCons: Flash + Camera, too many features\n\nOverall, this phone goes above and beyond what's needed on a day to day basis. The screen flow is smooth, application management is easy, and the battery life is over a day. The phone works much nicer if you turn off the animations, for which you have to go into the 'developer' options. Easy to do, though. The gorilla-glass is awesome!\n\nThe camera in the dark, however, needs a lot of help. In the daytime, the pictures are wonderful and the interface is pretty good. The phone is very thin, but sometimes I can't use just one hand to operate everything easily. Also, there are *too many* features, some of which are useless like waving your hand over the screen to scroll. These 'extra' features don't work that well, either. As with nearly every phone, Samsung tries to get you to go 'all Samsung' in terms of syncing information (especially when tied with Google). My previous phone did have a feature called \"Smart Actions\", which would turn on GPS automatically when my bluetooth connected to my car. I don't see that on the S4.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: This phone is fast. Really fast. it has all kinds of features and they all work great.\n\nCons: the battery life and the wifi both not the best\n\nThis phone had all the features you could want. If Even had an app that let's you control your TV and U-verse. The phone is super fast too. So far this is all you could want. Way better than the iphone", "Pros: Everything\n\nCons: Nothing that I have found yet\n\nI have a service business and use my cell for my clients to reach me. This phone has more features than I need but the screen is fantastic I use it for internet access when I am in a clients location and it always works great. I am now on my 4th smartphone but this one is the best I have seen.", "Pros: better than my last phone moto razor\n\nCons: start up to phone takes along time\n\nOverall a good phone. Plays videos great! The moto razor had a better camera though............", "Pros: Camera is the best\n\nCons: Volume control on my dre beats ear buds doesn't work or pandora link with my stereo\n\nOverall a nice phone personally think its to big. The phone also has flex which in a pocket feels like it can break. Batt life is ok if you don't run all the cool features it has to offer.", "Pros: Large, clear, and zoomable display\n\nCons: A bigger battery included, would have been nice.\n\nI use a Samsung Galaxy 3s for work. The subtle upgrades in operation shows real forward engineering. Can't wait to see what's next.", "Pros: camera\n\nCons: down loading\n\nnice phone. great screen and camera.\ni up graded from a droid x2 which i think was easier to use.....but i'm sure with time my phone will get easier to navigate.", "Pros: Learning curve was easy\n\nCons: Love it so far.\n\nThe phone was easy to learn how to get around. The battery last me thru the day with battery left. I use my phone all thru the day for business to email, text, take pictures, etc.... It's been great!", "Pros: Battery life is longer than any other device I've had.\n\nLong battery life and amazing screen display make this Galaxy S4 one of the greatest phones on the market today.", "Pros: Color and screen size\n\nCons: must talk directly into phone so they can hear you\n\nBattery life is great and no problems with my emails like my last phone. Never buy LG anything!", "Pros: Sharp clear pictures\n\nCons: Lacking Instruction Manual\n\nHighly advance phone with all the bells and whistles, however not user friendly for someone new to smart phones. No manual or instructions included to teach you how to use all of the features included with the phone. It's like buying a new car with no owners manual.", "Pros: battery screen android\n\nLove the phone. It's screen is beautiful, battery life is great for a smart phone. The Android operating system really shines. The new added hand gestures add a nice little touch that can be convenient if you so choose to use them. Overall a wonderful piece of equipment.", "Pros: great price only found at best buy\n\nCons: battery\n\nLove this phone. I think the only problem is the battery. I truly believe that the battery dies so fast because I cant stay off of it.... love it. It's a must have.", "Pros: Very intuitive. The gimicky functions actually work. Good looking.\n\nCons: Have to keep a charger nearby. I'd like to see spare batteries sold!\n\nI'm a long time Motorola owner, so I always assumed that advertised features always \"sort of worked\". I was one of those people who thought, well, if you want the latest gadget, with the newest technology, you have to expect it to be buggy and semi-functional. Not true!! This Samsung has got their s**t together! Some of the features like \"Smart Scroll\" may not have much real practical use, but it works! The hover feature is awesome, wave to answer, smart pause, all flawless! After being an early adopter to the original Droid, the Droid 2, the Bionic and the Razr, I got used to disappointing results. I am VERY surprised at how much I love this phone. Bye Motorola...\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Everything!\n\nCons: Battery could be a bit better, but still very good.\n\nThis phone has everything! Tons of apps! Superb camera! Super fast processing! 4G. What more could you ask for?", "Pros: Everything\n\nCons: Nothing\n\nThis phone is awesome. Haven't found anything wrong with it. So many things you can do with it. Camera is best on the market for cell phones. And the battery life is really impressive. If you're thinking of getting a new phone, this is the phone to get.", "Pros: battery life, camera features\n\nI started out with a Blackberry in 2005 then moved to the iPhone's and have upgraded to a new iPhone (including the 5) until I recently made the switch over to Android. I LOVE the swipe text and enjoy a longer battery life. Also, it is very customizable compared to the IPhone product. I would highly recommend this product!", "Pros: I like the ease of setting up the phone for my use.\n\nCons: I do wish the battery lasted longer\n\nI upgraded from a Droid X. I like the improvements and speed of the processor .", "Pros: camera\n\nCons: Not good for the simple person\n\nToo many things popping up accidently. Had to turn alot of the features off because I was accidently calling people by swiping a text message. My old android a swipe did something else. Can turn features on and off but I think this has too many features and will not work good for the simple person. I am far from simple and love techy things but I did not like this phone. Traded it in for an iPhone 5. ONly good thing with the samsung was the quality of the camera.", "Pros: camera and price\n\nCons: can be too many options and hands free motions are not as good as i thought.\n\nOverall great and happy with it. Just hands free motions are not as good as I thought they would be.", "Pros: Sharp clear pictures\n\nCons: Lacking Instruction Manual\n\nHighly advance phone with all the bells and whistles, however not user friendly for someone new to smart phones.

It's easy to use and the battery lasts longer than any other smart phone that I've had.", "Pros: camera\n\nCons: battery life\n\nBest phone ever. Better than the i phone. Pictures are amazing guality. Can control my tv, how cool is that? Csn even watch tv shows on it!", "Pros: battery life is ok but can be improved.\n\nCons: phone to big and not easy to handle.\n\nGood phone but was expecting more from a big brand like Samsung. Not enough storage space useless programs take up too much storage space.", "Pros: Additional features\n\nCons: Getting used to\n\nThis phone has lots of potential...once I learn to use it. Coming from years of iPhones there is a large learning curve to navigate, but that is more about the software than the phone itself. It is a solid phone rich with features not available anywhere else.", "Pros: Everything (including battery life)\n\nCons: Honestly, nothing\n\nI'm not going to get into an Apple vs. Android debate, but in terms of Android phones, this has to be the best phone on the market. The only true rival would be the HTC One, which isn't out for Verizon yet. While you're not going to go days without charging it, after a full day of normal use you won't have to charge the S4 until you go to bed. The screen is beautiful, it's very quick, and if you want the best Android available, this is the phone to get.", "Pros: Camera rocks, display is solid, and S-Voice leaves SIRI in the dust.\n\nCons: Nothing\n\nI had the Galaxy S3 and thought hard about simply buying my son another S3... glad I didn't. S4 is leaps and bounds better; even some of the included apps are worth it! S3 was good, S4 is even better.", "Pros: it does not have lag at all\n\nCons: I have not found anything not to like. emoticons need a app to view. screen take a bit of battery. to me its expected\n\nThis phone is the best as of 07/13 lol even ex iphone user's will be impressed.", "Pros: Love the screen size and weight of the phone\n\nI bought this phone on Memorial day and have been enjoying it ever since. It's got everything I need and more and I just love it!", "Pros: I've asked for more control in certain settings and got it!\n\nCons: Screen timeout does not give an option for NEVER!\n\nIt was remarkably easy to set up. The folders keep it uncluttered. And, when you open a folder and choose an app, the folder automatically closes -- love that. I was even able to clean up the apps menu with folders.\n\nI like to have control over my computer and android phones. The Samsung S4 gives me more choices in handling the apps and everything else. Bravo for that.\n\nThe camera takes great photos. The screen display is simply excellent and my iPhone friends rave about its quality and size.\n\nI can now communicate faster and easier with my friends. Helps me with scheduling, navigating and so much more.\n\nThank you Samsung -- you roc ...\nexpand \u00bb", "Pros: Picture, quickness, Battery\n\nCons: Nothing\n\nHighly recommend it to anyone. I truly enjoy the camera. Very easy and quick to use. Easy for txting. Talk to is nice.", "Pros: e mail, voice recognition, speed of phone\n\nCons: battery still won't last all day\n\nDispite the battery still the best phone. The Internet is great, the phone predicts what you want to do.", "Pros: Easy to get set up\n\nI have enjoyed owning this phone. It is my first smartphone and I was nervous it was going to be difficult to use. So far, all basic functions have been easy to get to know and use.", "Pros: Awesome features\n\nCons: Battery life is not the greatest.\n\nI really love this phone! I've always felt skeptical about Samsung phones because I've always been a big HTC fan, but between the features and the feel of the phone the S4 has totally killed my skepticism. Everything about this phone is just amazing!", "Pros: I love the camera. very clear pictures!\n\nCons: I wish this phone had a flashlight like my evo did.\n\nAll my friends talked about how great this phone us, so i had to get one. All I can say is that im one happy camper!", "Pros: screen, camera, user interface, fun bonus tweaks like infer red remote and extra sensors built in\n\nCons: originally overpriced, (great deal now), just barely too big. 4.8\" would be perfect for me.\n\nI bought this phone through BB instead of Verizon and saved a boatload! Love the options coming from an old rooted Evo 4g with JB rom. Moving up to the real thing is amazing. The phone is lightning fast and stable. Went back and forth on which color but finally landed on black and LOVE it.\n\nThe S4 is probably already an 8 or 9/10 when stock. For those who are tech savvy and chose to run a custom Rom, its super customizable, light, fast, dependable, and totally blows anything else away.\n\nI looked hard at the One, especially coming from an HTC... but no battery access and a very difficult to repair phone is not what I need, even if it looks super sleek.\nAluminum looks awesome, but damages easily and add weight. The S4 \"feels light\" and I'm actually very okay with that.\n\nThe One is a Lamborghini kit car...looks great on the exterior. But unfortunately HTC stopped short.\nThe S4 is a twin turbo and European leather hiding inside a nice looking \"average\" car. (And still looks pretty sweet to me).\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: This phone is easy to use , lots of features\n\nCons: Haven't found any ...\n\nthis phone size was larger then my last phone ( pantech breakout), which I didn't know if I would like, but after using it I loved the larger size. This phone by far is more advanced then any other phone I have ever owned. The camera takes better pics then my regular camera I use. The phone loads Apps real quick and I love all the features.\nSamsung did a great job with this phone .", "Pros: Larger screen, great camera and easy to set up pages\n\nCons: Needed help from teenagers to set up all the features\n\nThe screen is much larger & easier to read. Very easy to set up pages & organize apps. Battery life better than Droid2X.", "Pros: Ease of use\n\nCons: Have not found anything yet\n\nI had a Galaxy S3 before and was not happy with it. So I checked out the iphone and the S4. I really liked how it felt and thought the iPhone to be small. So I got the S4. I am really surprised how user friendly it is. Much better than the S3. It has many features I really enjoy and use constantly. I am glad I stayed with a Samsung product. Got myself the Samsung pad as well.", "Pros: good price, large screen, smooth operating system.\n\nCons: battery life on any Smart Phone\n\nI've waited about a month after buying the phone to make this review because I didn't want to get caught up in the moment. This phone is excellent, the large screen is great for surfing thw inter-webs and when I use Netflix. The phone has given me no problems.", "Pros: EVERYTHING else is spectacular\n\nCons: Ring tones are not very loud at full volume\n\nI have had the original Galaxy s Vibrant since it first came out and had been very satisfied. The S4 makes that seem like a dinsaur! amazing cameras, very good battery life, easy to use", "Pros: battery life, light weight\n\nCons: iPhone\n\nJust get the phone. You'll love it. A few of my friends that had the iPhone converted to the S4. What does that tell ya?", "Pros: Quick operation, no issues to date\n\nCons: Smooth enough that it is easy to drop\n\nOverall, a very good phone. Great screen, great functionality, and I really like the camera. The sound from the speaker is average, but I generally stick to headphones with it. A good case will keep it from sliding out of your hand, and also will keep the screen off the table when face down.", "Pros: Fast!\n\nCons: Bloatware\n\nThis is a wonderful phone. Very fast & responsive. Camera takes beautiful pictures. Battery lasts longer than the extended battery in my Bionic. My only gripes are 1) Too much bloatware that you can't remove without rooting and voiding your warranty and 2) the features that Verizon disables or removes from the phone that the same phone on other carriers have. Though that's a Verizon issue not really a phone issue.", "Pros: picture\n\nCons: has a weird delay after calls.\n\nlight phone. great picture. Phone has a awful delay after calls. This phone is great if you are a media junkie(twitter, facebook). otherwise to use as a phone and text and occasional surf, u will be aggrevated.", "Pros: Ease of Use, & Intuitive\n\nCons: Battery life is better, but not perfect\n\nThe S4 is an AMAZING smart phone. Samsung knocked it out of the park with this one. Inutitive O/S, amazing features, the camera is excellent, and the battery life is improved over the S3. No smart phone has a perfect battery, but the S4 is the best blend of everything I have ever used. Why would anyone ever buy an Appl* product again??", "Pros: best phone on the market\n\nCons: size\n\nI love my new galaxy s4. Takes great photos and is great to watch Netflix on while commuting to work. I would recommendthis phone to anyone", "Pros: Powerful phone with great features\n\nCons: Stock battery doesn't last a day with heavy usage (but what phone does?)\n\nThis phone is pretty incredible. The powerful processor eats whatever I throw at it and it is very smooth and responsive. The adapt sound feature makes music sound great and it is nice to watch video on the huge screen in full (1080p) HD> The phone is big but after a short while every other phone is just too small to me!. Love my Galaxy S4 and I will not be counting down the days until my next upgrade like I did in the past!", "Pros: Ease of use\n\nCons: Have not found anything yet\n\nI had a Galaxy S3 before and was not happy with it. So I checked out the iphone and the S4. I really liked how it felt and thought the iPhone to be small. So I got the S4. I am really surprised how user friendly it is. Much better than the S3. It has many features I really enjoy and use constantly. I am glad I stayed with a Samsung product. Got myself the Samsung pad as well.", "Pros: it's fast and great battery life.\n\nCons: Air push could be annoying sometimes\n\nLove this phone. So many great features. Toke me a few days to get use to the phone but worth it", "Pros: picture in picture\n\nCons: eye motion doesn't work if you have glasses\n\nI was very excited to get the S4. My daughter has an S3 and loves it so I was hoping to have the same reaction to the S4. Didn't happen. First of all, the eye motion doesn't work if you have glasses, which I do. Second, the hand wave through photos or even to answer the phone is very sensitive. Unfortunately I am usually in a hurry so it was easier for me to just flip though with my fingers, the old fashioned way. I ended up returning the S4 and got an S3 instead. I am happy with my choice, and of course Best Buy is always helpful and easy to work with on returns.", "Pros: Size of the Phone, Comfortable, Easy to Read\n\nSamsung S4 is everything that you want in a phone / Android Device.\nThe good news is the readability of the phone and the touch screen.\nThe size is even good to \"read\" a book when you forget your tablet.\nFast connections, Great WIFI and Camera is exceptional.", "Pros: Great features\n\nCons: none\n\nThis is my first smart phone and it's awesome. the rest of my family have iPhone 4 I like this a lot more very easy to use and does a bunch of cool stuff", "Pros: Screen, camera and video.\n\nCons: All the techno garbage to do with visual recognition\n\nI came from an IPHONE and am not an IPHONE lover or I would not have switched. Nothing special here, way below the hipe. Battery life is marginal unless you turn off many of the features. The Camera and especially the video can be stunning. A big plus there, but the rest of the new features with the hand gestures and eye recognition don't work well enough to bother with. The hover can be more of a nuisance than help. Please get back to basic development of phone communications - speeding up display and reducing cost of data pushes my buttons.", "Pros: Latest gadget has all the bells & whistles\n\nCons: Short battery life and vibration mode does not rock my\n\nExcited to be sending off my BB to the Smithsonian and getting what I hope will be the last smart phone I purchase for at least half a decade.\nFirst S4 was faulty (headphone slot didn't perform) so had to return it to Best Buy. That's about four wasted hours of my life I'll never get back. There was that downloading of contacts (twice), and protecting the investment (twice) when the 2nd one was finally ready to go. Have had it about a month now, and still have a lot to learn about all the available features. Like the auto-fill when texting. Utilize the power saving settings as I am disappointed with how quickly the battery drains. Wife has the I-Phone 5. Best part about that is I don't have to answer her never ending questions with anything but; \"Gosh, Honey, I'm so sorry, but I've got the android and know absolutely nothing about your phone.\" Sweet!\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Battery life is awesome, at least 2 days on a single charge\n\nCons: Haven't found anything I don't like yet\n\nGot the S4 on release day for Verizon. Battery life is amazing. Camera is awesome and the things you can do with the photos is great. More options than most point and shoot cameras. Haven't had any complaints yet.", "Pros: FAST!!!\n\nCons: Ringtone Volume\n\nGreat device, lives up to and beyond it's hype. Only negative is the loudness of the ringtone. I've missed more call in 2 weeks than I've ever missed with my other Droid's (original Droid, Incredible 2, Bionic). Speaker phone in the car isn't that loud either (or it's my hearing...). Need to use a 3.5 jack and plug it into your car's audio system to drive hands free. Otherwise a great device!", "Pros: Great bang for the buck!\n\nCons: Photos are so good that default settings are often too large for some photo apps.\n\nThe Galaxy 4S is nothing short of having a literal pocket pc. Extremely fast speeds in relation to Internet 4G and over all device performance. The predictive texting feature is much richer than other devices that I've used in the past. Other features such as facial recognition and hands free scrolling just add the icing to the cake. It's a highly recommend switch from that fruit company if you love to be in control of your technology.", "Pros: size, programs, apps\n\nCons: i dont know yet\n\namazing phone. I have had it for awhile now and yet to find anything wrong with it. The reception is better than my last phone but thats just networking. As for the phone, the people at GeekSquad and they helped my pick the right phone for me. I buy all my electronics from Best Buy and will continue to do so loyally.", "Pros: Vibrant and perfect size\n\nCons: battery could be better. does not last anything like advertised. but alot better than previous droid I had.\n\nWent to get note because I thought built in stylus was way to go. To my pleasent surprise got this phone in stock earlier that day. Note just seemed too big. Like tablet on side. This phone perfect size and has infer red tech. Possibilities r endless...", "Pros: Screen, camera, maps are great.\n\nCons: May not have as much apps as the iPhone but android is working on that.\n\nIf you are debating iPhone5 vs. galaxy 4. As I previous iPhone user, the galaxy 4s will not disappoint.", "Pros: easy to use and fabulous graphics\n\nCons: nothing yet\n\nI replaced my Samsung htc that had the shortest battery life of any phone I have ever had. This is great on battery life.", "Pros: easy to figure out, love that\n\nCons: I can't think of anything that I don't like.\n\nI just love this phone. Very easy to use and find things. Takes beautiful pics.", "Pros: Great features, great hardware\n\nCons: Picture quality is still not as good as an iPhone\n\nWhile the picture features are great, the actual quality still leaves something to be desired. I still get blurry pictures even when holding it still.", "Pros: This phone is super high tech.\n\nCons: I have no complaints.\n\nI saw this phone in Best Buy while shopping for something else and asked the Samsung guy to demonstrate it for me. After the demonstration I wanted the phone because of it's amazing capabilities. This phone will scroll through web pages by following your eye and head movements and you can also wave your hand to scroll. It has an app for cable TV which will download a channel guide and after syncing the phone with the cable box I can use it to change channels. The camera has a bunch of different modes too. I like the panorama mode myself. These are just a few of the amazing capabilities of this phone. Go see a demo for yourself and find out what else it can do if you're interested.", "Pros: large screen that's good for an old man like me\n\nCons: hard to find a case for it\n\nI've had droids I phones you name it I've had one. So when I say this phone is one of the best, I mean it. For beginners and experts alike.", "Pros: It is so user friendly and everything is so easy to read.\n\nCons: Nothing!\n\nMy husband and I share this phone and we both love it. It is so user friendly. We had a phone before with no internet and thought it would be intimidating but it is not. We did a lot of research before we made the decision to get the Galaxy s4 but it has been more than we expected.", "Pros: fast, features, camera...etc\n\nCons: no built in car dock app\n\nLove the phone... Samsung did an incredible job, much better than the bionic. Only wish there was a built in car dock app and svoice still needs a lot of work.", "Pros: size, programs, apps\n\nCons: i dont know yet\n\namazing phone.

I'll be buying one for my daughter and another for my grand-daughter.", "Pros: multi window setting\n\nCons: headphone jack already out in less than a month\n\nI had a hard time with connecting in the beginning. My headphone jack is out and i encrypted my device and cant turn it off. Plus the hotspot feature is not available.", "Pros: Excellent in store classes for beginners, intermediates and experts\n\nCons: Don't know yet...\n\nSo far making the transition from Samsung Galaxy Prevail to S4 has\nbeen effortless. Camera is excellent for all kinds of use. Paired with an Otter Box, it's just about indestructible.", "Pros: Features\n\nCons: I wish you could move apps to the SD Card.\n\nSo far it is a great phone. It has tons of features. I keep discovering new ones every day. The only down side to the phone is the fact that you can save apps to the SD card.", "Pros: The quality of the phone\n\nCons: The price was kind of high\n\nThis phone has alot of features, I'm still learning how to use it. But so far I am truely liking this phone.", "Pros: Great picture and sound quality. The camera is superb. Ultra fast and no problem running multiple apps.\n\nCons: None really.\n\nGreat phone, no real issues. I had the S3 for a month and I must admit that there is no perceivable difference between the S4 and the S3. If you want to save some money, get the S3. If you want the latest and have the money, get the S4.", "Pros: Great battery life, amazing camera!\n\nI LOVE this phone. Samsung's products never dissapoint me. Although it's a huge jump for me personally (from a Fascinate in the original Galaxy Series), I know this phone isn't as huge of leaps and bounds as the S III was. However it's still a Samsung phone that is going to outlast all of the common problems that many other brands have.", "Pros: Have some awesome features, that other phone lacks without compromising the required functions.\n\nCons: camera in low light.\n\nGreat device to have at this time. This has some awesome features which are good to have. May not be necessary all the time. But for me who likes to explore all the features, this is a pandora's box.", "Pros: Big bright screen, smooth experience\n\nCons: Too light\n\nGreat phone... the screen is fabulous. And it does not look so big even at 5 inch display. It's actually smaller than S3.\n\nHappy with the purchase and would recommend to anybody!", "Pros: The layout\n\nCons: Being sold an outdated phone without be told.\n\nBeing sold an outdated phone without being told it was updated months ago! The one I was sold doesn't have Spark and I was told it could not be upgraded. Best Buy has yet to respond to my emails.", "Pros: larger display, great for those of us that are no longer young.\n\nCons: don't know yet.\n\nI have enjoyed it, the camara works great and the apps available make more useful.", "Pros: Battery life (1 to 1.5 day) has been improved compared to my old smart phones (1/2 day - unacceptable).\n\nCons: Nothing bad to say, but would like battery to several days.\n\nThis is a good phone. Phone works well. Nothing bad to say.", "Pros: easy to navigate\n\nCons: very large\n\nThe phone is great and definitely does everything I need it to do and more. I just wish I had the mini version as it is very large.", "Pros: Pictures, easy to share\n\nCons: Not enough training to use for new user smart phone\n\nEase of use for advanced, not so for newbie. Pictures are great and easy to share.", "Pros: Everything in one location\n\nCons: Batter life could be better\n\nI was due to get a new phone and was able to upgrade two days early by going in to Best Buy. First of all, great service. Secondly, great phone. I had a Droid back in 2010 and had down-sized to a basic phone to save money. Although I did slash my bill, I missed having my planner and a camera at my fingertips. Now I do --- this all-inclusive phone gets the job done and enables me to go places without taking too much in excess (i.e. bag, cameria, planner, ipod, GPS etc.). Great product!", "Pros: camera/ computer and awesome features\n\nCons: phone reception is awful\n\nThe operation of this phone is great with a fantastic camera and some great features. If the phone would actually work as a phone it would be great. I own trucks and running my nightly run the reception of this phone is the worst of any phone I have owned in several years. The phone drops calls constantly and has no reception in many ares that all of my previous phones did. If you want to do everything but make calls this is a great \"phone\"", "Pros: it's the right size and the Apps are Awesome i use it for work and home!\n\nCons: nothing so far!\n\nI left the Iphone Family after 10 years and I'm very pleased with this phone the S4 is better than any of the Iphones I had and I will never go back!!", "Pros: It's user friendly and we'll smart.\n\nCons: battery life is a little disappointing.\n\nI would definitely recommend this phone to all my family and friends. It's the the best phone I've owned so far.", "Pros: everything about this phone is great. the music , pics.i love the mic search and mic texting.\n\nthis is a great phone. i had a differant smart phone and it was half as nice. this was so easy to learn. i love it.", "Pros: Everything!\n\nCons: Everything's great!\n\nI have absolutely no complaints about this phone. The battery life is good, it never freezes and I can use multiple apps or do multiple things at once.", "Pros: Everything\n\nCons: Nothing\n\nWhat can I say.. It's a Verizon Samsung S4. great all around phone. You should get one.. Now more then ever because the S5 is doing out so you can get a great deal on yours.", "Cons: screen freezes constantly\n\nInitially, I really enjoyed my s4. I'd had a \"dumb\" smart phone and was looking forward to a \"real\" smart phone. From November to March - true. Then Samsung did an update. Then the screen started freezing...constantly...even while doing a task - any task and any screen. Took it back. Samsung people looked at it. Geek Squad looked at it. They sent it back. I got a replacement phone that is just as bad, if not worse. Problem still not fixed. Now it's going back again.", "Pros: Features\n\nCons: Compatibility\n\nMy only disappointment is that the phone is not fully compatible with my 2014 Honda. Can't get the phone book, last numbers, etc.", "Pros: Everything. Battery lasts all day!\n\nLove the phone. It is great. Better than my old phone the galaxy epic. I don't get new phones very often but I love the way it works.", "Pros: All the bells whistles\n\nCons: So many options that you have to be careful or battery life is short.\n\nThis is my first smart phone, it's great and does what I need. The Samsung rep Eric was great. He took his time and showed me how to use it with making me fell dumb, and asked me to come back anytime if I have more questions.", "Pros: the size is right for me, HD play back, can play games that didn't work on my other phone,\n\nCons: phone service doesn't work in some areas of West Bend,WI\n\nIt has great HD play backs, can play games on it that I wasn't able to play before on my other cell phone. It's a great size fits in my pocket of my jacket.\nI got this phone for my 3 boys ages 20, 15 & 12 years old. They like it !!!!", "Pros: The Available Features\n\nCons: My Charger doesn't charge\n\nThe phone replaced my IPhone,Was getting bored with the Iphone and wasn't sure if I would like the Samsung, I love the available features. Hope Best buy will replace my charger since it hasn't worked since i bought the phone( lucky theres another samsung in the house)", "Pros: Battery life is impressive - single charge most days\n\nCons: Like most cell phones, I wish there was more volume available through the on board speaker\n\nI watch videos, stream music, and play games off and on through the day and most days, the battery has enough charge to make through. Replaced a Bionic with the extended battery and this lasts longer.", "Pros: It's got a great picture and really easy to set up\n\nCons: It's easy to drop unless you have a good case\n\nThe first time I've ever owned a Samsung phone.

I'm just a plan guy that only really use a cell for just making calls. Really love this phone and all it can do.", "Pros: everything. very user friendly\n\nCons: battery needs charging daily. not really that problematic\n\nGreatest phone I have ever had. My last phone was a Motorola razer x which was a joke compared to the Samsung galaxy 4. I will only purchase Samsung products in the future. I own a Samsung smart tv and it is greatest tv I have ever had and that includes some Sony's too.", "Pros: Great phone\n\nI previously had an EVO 4G, but the Samsung feels like a much more premium phone. I get much better signal strength and the phone feels really snappy, love it!", "Pros: Can practically do everything with it.I hardly use my computer anymore\n\nCons: short battery life\n\nLove this phone. I have had it a while now and still finding new and usefulo and fun things that I can do with it. Down side all these likes do not help the battery life", "Pros: The feature everything. It's exactly the same as the s3 ( if you have one or had)\n\nCons: If you're the type to take alot of selfies it makes you look like you have too much edit.\n\nGreat camera, good size if you don't like huge phones like the note 3 or the mega. Great for business and personal use. Great phone overall I'm happy with my purchase ! :)", "Pros: easy to navigate\n\nCons: haven't found anything yet\n\nI previously had an iPhone and was a little bit skeptical. After learning how to use the galaxy I would never go back to an iPhone. I love it.", "Pros: easy to use\n\nCons: LOTS of options available in the menu\n\nthis phone is outright fantastic! it is a little bigger than my old phone but i became used to that quickly. i truly enjoy the speed of 4G after having 3G for so long!", "Pros: Superior resolution and call quality\n\nCons: Color selection\n\nThis is a great device for surfing the web, texting, email, taking photos, listening to music. Great hand and eye recognition features and very intuitive. The picture is simply outstanding and this device still has a removable battery. Battery life is outstanding.", "Pros: Screen\n\nCons: touchy side controls\n\nI'm am thoroughly impressed with the new S4 it is amazingly light weight and the screen is truly bright and color is up the wow factor on the product.

I'm just a plan guy that only really use a cell for just making calls. Really love this phone and all it can do.", "Pros: Beautiful screen\n\nCons: Little big\n\nYou sacrifice compact size but gain a near edge to edge screen. Colors really pop. I use my phone for pretty much everything but making phone calls. Love the functionality.", "I have owned a number of smartphones and I have purchased smartphones for my family. The Samsung Galaxy S4 is by far the best phone that I have bought. It is responsive and the battery life gets me through an entire day of my normal usage.", "Pros: Stepping up from my HTC Evo 4G LTS. I am beyond pleased.\n\nCons: A little hesitant when opening windows and apps. Could be faster.\n\nI REALLY love this phone. I am amazed by all the features. I have yet to learn the phone totally. So much better than my HTC Evo 4G LTE. I am so happy I chose this phone.", "Pros: easy to learn to use and navigate\n\nBought this phone for my wife.

I would totally recommend both the product and best buy to anyone wanting to purchase a cell phone/plan.", "Pros: large screen\n\nCons: large size\n\nThe large screen is nice, but it does (naturally) make the phone itself pretty large.

Would definitely recommend.", "Pros: does all I need\n\nCons: battery life\n\nI am very surprised all the things this phone will do. I am puzzled as to why a Billion Dollar company must charge extra for so many things.", "Pros: technology is awesome.\n\nCons: haven't had any problems yet\n\nI like the phone and the speed is fast too.

The voice commands and air gestures are not reliable.

When I received the black phone, I found that it very nicely was supplied with earphones and charger. But unfortunately, both of these are white. To make matters worse, after attempting to register the phone on the Samsung website (for warranty purposes, etc.) I could not locate this model GT-19500. I then e-mailed Samsung and learned that this model did not appear on their web site as it is a Non-US/International phone. Samsung recommended I contact either the ineternational website or the seller. I e-mailed the seller and have NEVER heard from that company. Also, received a response from Best Buy telling me to contact Samsung as that is where Bes ...\nexpand \u00bb", "Pros: no glitches, good quality overall\n\nCons: don't like it opening apps by self and I can't manage the apps\n\nOver all good just a little annoying not being able to manage or get rid of apps I do not want. taking me a bit to get used to the size but love the quality.", "Pros: screen size\n\nPreviously had iPhone 4.

I'm also getting to like it better as I learn to use it.", "Pros: It's feature packed installed applications\n\nCons: A larger battery would have been nice\n\nHaving the phone for about a month now,I really love all of the features contained within it. And the processing power it uses to execute every task.", "Pros: 13mp camera, resolution\n\nCons: Can't think of anything as of this date and time.\n\nTalked to a sales rep and bought this phone for $50.00 dollars with free shipping.

I understand it is not perfect, I get the most battery life because I disabled all the (useless) bells and whistles, not as snappy as the iphone and the sound is definitely not to par with the Ipod and music oriented Iphone quality, but overall I feel like I can finally get the most use out of my smartphone and have about 99% of the same apps I had before. Sorry Apple, I have no need for your next-gen phone, larger screen or not.", "Pros: Price was right and good service so far\n\nCons: Still learning\n\nAs a novice user am still learning how to use the phone.\nso far it fits my needs and the one thing I really like is the fact that I can now text by voice rather than having to type my message.", "Pros: Overall love the larger screen\n\nCons: Emojis arent part of the phone...but theres an app for that\n\nI love this phone...I am a die hard Apple fan but apple has not stepped up their game when it come to technology and the screen size.

I am the opposite of techy so when my husband also got the same phone I knew I had an in home tutor to show me all of the phones tricks. So far the transition has been super simple. I got the phone home and started customizing right away. I love the Android operating system with all of the free apps and widgets! The phone I had would overheat and die within hours, but Best Buy was super helpful and got me a new device and it's been problem free ever since.

I am sure it does a LOT more that I am using it for, with time I will figure it out. My brother in law added some apps and I am so happy I changed this phone. It is a bit hard to hold on too hands free, so I carry a little purse and out my phone inside when using a headset, I guess a blue tooth would help.

When people ask me which one I like more my answer is indifferent. My iPhone worked just fine when I traded and was just in the mood for something different. The Galaxy is just that, different.

In the short time that I have had the upgrade, it has done nothing but impress me more than the S III did; it is everything the S III was and wasn't. It is going to take something quite spectacular to lure me away from the Samsung genius and quality that they provide for me to want another product when it is time to upgrade.", "Pros: Size, technology, and camera\n\nCons: N/A\n\nWill never go back to an Iphone after buying the S4.

Now it lasts up to 20-23 hours. I uses my phone frequently. There's so much more to this phone versus I the iPhone.

However, since I am middle age and not so tech savy, it will take me a while to learn how to take all the shot cuts and use it most effectively. Otherwise, it is fantastic!!", "Pros: pretty much everything. the screen is responsive, it never bogs down, it has more than enough options to personalize....\n\nCons: took a bit to set up, mainly because i don't like all the standard apps that come with (IE: youtube, tripadvisor, etc)\n\nafter getting all the annoying stuff shut down and my favorite apps downloaded, i can't put the thing down! i haven't had ANY problems with it and i generally find SOMETHING i don't like. moving from the EVO 4g to this was like getting out of a bad relationship and into true love!", "Pros: I love the things it will do.

Speedy, packed with innovative features, an incredible camera, and a screen size almost worthy of an iPad Mini, the S4 is easier to transition to from an iPhone than most people might think. Yes, there is a learning curve, but the salespeople and techies at Best Buy are incredibly helpful. They're usually so busy, but they make you feel like you're the only customer they have that day and are eager to answer questions, even when you've left the store. The only major downside to the S4 so far is battery life, but with a phone that does so much, there's only so much you can ask of it!

My friend has the Samsung Galaxy S3 and I knew that when I was ready for a smart phone the Samsung Galaxy was my phone of choice. When I saw the Samsung Galaxy S4 I fell in love!! . I like how simple it is to use, and for someone who knows nothing about smart phones this was definately a smart choice :) At first I thought it would be hard to use, but I was wrong.

Good sales folks.", "Pros: The Camera is awesome!\n\nCons: I have not found anything that I would actually complain about.\n\nThe only thing I would change would be to have this one more durable.

I have always been an iPhone user so was hesitant to buy this but I'm so glad I did. Awesome phone.", "Excellent phone, then again, I expect the same from Samsung..good quality products.

It does everything you can expect out mom a phone and more.", "Pros: Easy to use, fun, beautiful screen, light weight, fast processing\n\nCons: Nothing yet\n\nI held out for 3 years with an HTC Thunderbolt and thought \"it's just fine.\" I've never loved a phone like this one. It's so fast and beautiful. The battery life so far has been exceptional though I've only had it for about 6 weeks. I really can't think of anything I haven't loved about this phone.

Video quality, internet browser, camera apps, games - all these things are more than just added perks, they're expected, and Samsung stepped up it's game and provided just that. The Samsung Galaxy S4 holds true to it's over-glorified fan-boy reviews with its brilliant colorful display and extraordinarily fast processor speed. The sound quality, I will admit, is not up to par with the earth shattering speakers of the HTC One, however, is just right, and not obnoxiously overpowering, unlike the excelling quality of pictures that the 13mp camera produces - setting the bar high for any future smart phones to come. The camera is quick, and on point, allowing you to take multiple different types of photos from the dramatic multi-shot, to the sound-embedded photo for those who want a \"not-quite-a-video\" moment of memory to hold on to and share. Speaking of sharing, I found it quite handy having the Facebook icon right there on the photo (in gallery) to share instantly with all my family and friends out there in the world. While I must say that some may find their own unique quirks about the Samsung Galaxy S4, I found it much to my own liking, and take it for what it is - a beautiful phone with many over-the-top benefits for user satisfaction and enjoyment.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Who needs a computer anymore?

The apps don't work as they should and all the features that Samsung advertises for their \"flagship\" phone, don't even work close to how they are supposed to. Everyone complains about how Apple has such a tight control over their apps and what they allow to be available for the public but it's for good reason. They make sure they work seamlessly with the operating system.

Apps I want to use and that don't work at all or as they should Avidia Bank, GoToMyPC, and Skype (won't do video). Samsung also keep the Kies program a big secret I found it buried on the website in a FAQ. It's and excellent program to link your PC to your phone and transfer your email contacts over.

If you are not sure why Aluminum is called the premium body material, then just simply compare the quality of exteriors of HTC One and S4.\nWhy pays the premium price for a sub-standard plastic phone S4??? S4 is not anywhere cheaper than HTC One. If you look at the cost of producing a plastic-case like Galaxy S4, that cost is around a couple of bucks maximum (This production process is called \u201cInjection molding\u201d \u2013 in which you melt some raw plastic balls, and inject melted fluid into a pre-shaped mold, then leave it cool \u2013 there you go, you get a plastic S4 case.) This is exactly why all the cheap-plastic stuff cost $1 in Dollar General. The review from the other user asked \u201cSince when is aluminum a premium material?\u201d, I can tell you - you can find all sorts of plastic things in dollar store, this is exactly why plastic is cheap-to-look, cheap-to-feel, cheap-to-produce, and cheap-to-have. The other comment says that once you scratch it, it is no longer premium. This really puts me in laugh. If that comment is true, then next time when you make a car purchase, don\u2019t bother to buy the car with nice paint and surface \u2013 because once it\u2019s scratched, it is no longer good looking - I can\u2019t think any sensible person would have a comment like that.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: EVERYTHING\n\nThis smartphone is by far the best I have ever had.

However, it's too big to comfortable talk on for long periods of time or to slip in and out of your pocket. It's Android, so it's totally customizable in pretty much every way, but that can get complex pretty fast. It's not as intuitive and I would have hoped, and it took a while to get used to it.

It is hard to not lose \"phone quality\" when so much is pumped into the device to make apps and web browsing better. All-in-all I would say Samsung is definitely the way to go.", "Pros: The size, the color and the ease of going from one screen to the next screen.\n\nCons: So far, it has given me more than my other phone.\n\nI have this phone for more space to download apps.", "Pros: performance\n\nCons: settings\n\nsettings is weird especially if youre used a different phone from before but as far as performance and battery, it works great if you know how to use it.", "Pros: Camera\n\nCons: Phone freezes (have to remove battery to restart), touch screen is unresponsive on occasion.\n\nDisappointed in its overall performance...but I may just have a lemon.

Not really the phone's fault since it was designed as that, but it's a bit of a pain to type on and the auto correct is something awful. The pre-loaded apps it has on it are also really confusing to go through and manage, it's like 4 pages worth of stuff I'll never use!", "Pros: Operating system is easy to navigate, phone has a lot of features for the price\n\nCons: Battery life is somewhat short\n\nI had the Samsung Galaxy S2, so I knew what to expect when buying this phone.

So I'm not happy about that at all especially when I came from a Company were I had no issues with the device just the Internet.", "Pros: Screen size\n\nCons: Bat life and android\n\nThis is good phone but not worth it if upgrading from a gs3.

I thought the S5 did not make sense.", "Pros: Lots of options, with good hardware to back it up.\n\nCons: Call quality suffers a bit after updates. Plastic feel to phone.\n\nAnother great phone from samsung with a big pretty super AMOLED screen. There are plenty of beautiful customizable options along with good useful pre installed software. The hardware of the phone is strong enough to handle everything, including multitasking with the multiple program window. Where the phone suffers, is the the same flaws as previous Gallaxy S versions. A cheap plastic feel and the call quality suffers after Android's newest update. This could be related specifically to the update though and not the phone itself.", "Pros: a lot of nice features. I need time to learn how to use them all.\n\nCons: the battery discharges too quickly\n\nthis is my first smart phone . I have an i touch so I am familiar with how to use a lot of the features but there is a lot to learn. I am very happy so far with my new phone and I really like the fact I can take classes to learn how to make the most of it. it is a little larger than some of the phones I looked at and I really like it. it is so much easier to view email and pictures with the larger screen but not too large to be inconvenient.", "Pros: Easy to use, happy with the size & features\n\nCons: Doesn't have emoji's\n\nComing from a Droid 3, I'm very happy with this phone.

The Samsung S4 is by far my favorite of all the others I've had. It has the ability to do anything I may need it to do, with the exception of possibly driving my vehicle for me. But if I continued searching thru my new phone, I'd probably find an app for that as well :-) Aside from the very short battery life, I have no complaints about the S4.

I've searched for the option to do so on Samsung's website without success and didn't want to post via social media. First of all, my purchase experience at Best Buy was great. The associate was very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. I completed my purchase in less time that expected and went out the door happy to have an item my daughter requested for Christmas. My 17 year old daughter wanted to switch from Iphone to Samsung, so we purchased a Galaxy S4 as a Christmas gift for her. Didn't get a case because I wanted to let her choose one. HUGE MISTAKE! Within 4 hours the screen was cracked. The phone fell from her pocket, mere inches to the floor, and it made a hairline crack across the screen. STRIKE ONE. Then the phone started getting really hot when it was charging. Like, uncomfortable to the touch hot. STRIKE TWO. Hugely concerned because my daughter sleeps with the phone charging on her bed, called Best Buy customer service and they said return it to the store. Since the closest store is 45 minutes from us, it wasn't something we could immediately attend to and just kept a close eye on it while charging. The final straw came when the phone was accidentally knocked into a toilet FOR ALL OF TWO SECONDS. We immediately took the phone apart and since it was late at night, hit google for some advice. Most comments said put it in a container of rice and leave it for several days. We did that, for 5 days. The phone will power on, but the screen flashes continually. Called Samsung customer service and was basically told not to bother sending it in for repair as 10 times out of 10 it would come back BRR (beyond resonable repair) or something similar. STRIKE THREE. I realize there is some user error involved here, but we're hugely disappointed in this first Samsung mobile experience.

I think\n\nWent in to upgrade to the Iphone5C on sale(free)! But, missed it by one day, so hello GalaxyS4. Had a Droid X. Yeah, yeah, I know. Ancient. But what a difference. Glad I stuck with Android, since I'm basically a tech nerd. Still figuring out all of the many features and am pretty amazed at the ease of effort. I use it for pretty much for everything. Even business. I had before, as well. But the difference is ...now I'm finding that I actually use it!!! Camera is so much better and easier(front/back) view, sharp pics. Typing is similar to the Iphone. (did not expect that!) Screen larger. Overall, I would choose the Galaxy over the Iphone5 series.", "Pros: alot of great stuff\n\nCons: no negatives\n\nThis phone has a lot of bells and whistles and I like all that I have used.

I have not found anything wrong except for the battery. Once I learned how to use it I was very happy with it. I would like to find time to personalize it just the way I want for me. I will have to find time soon.", "Pros: I love all the features.\n\nCons: I wish the battery would be longer.\n\nI recently converted from LG to Samsung. Best decision I made.This android phone is awesome!!! I am definitely sold on Samsung products! I will buy another Samsung phone!", "Pros: Easy to use, great picture, internal memory is awesome\n\nCons: Speakers aren't great, battery could stand to last longer.\n\nThis phone is probably one of the best things I've ever used in my life. I happened to get it on sale, but even for the normal price (which is what I was going to buy it for initially) it is 100% worth it. The screen is nice and big, very clear and sharp picture. The built-in speaker isn't the best, but it is loud and clear, though I recommend earphones of some sort. The battery is slowly losing capacity, but it still lasts longer than most other phone's I've used. Overall, I'd give it a 9/10. Speakers aren't a huge problem, and I'm constantly using the phone so the batteries could be my fault anyway.", "Very happy with my purchase!! This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my son and he is very please with the quality of this outstanding product. Samsung always holds to this and the service we received at our local neighborhood Best Buy is unparalleled to the competitor.", "Pros: The features are great. i was able to buy it in my favorite color.

I was also able to buy it in my favorite color.", "Pros: So many different features\n\nCons: Seems much slower than iphone\n\nI do like it and also the size, it's is slow if compared to iphone 5s, I have both so best of both worlds", "Pros: I got the phone for free on Black Friday.\n\nCons: Too easy to touch the wrong thing, also placement of buttons.\n\nI really like the phone a lot - I came from a qwerty keyboard and so getting used to totally going touchscreen as opposed to having the options of keys as well has been a really hard transition. I also don't like the volume button being straight across from the on/off button. When grasping the phone - you wind up pushing one when you had no intentions of pushing something and it will mess up whatever you're in the middle of.", "Pros: customization\n\nCons: learning curve\n\nBeen iphone fanboy from day one, but now that I've got the Galaxy s4 Android I'm really liking it more and more not sure I would go back to a iphone. I really like all the customization u can do. If ur not phone or computer savvy u might not like it, you got to give it time and learn the phone before judging it", "Pros: Easy to figure out\n\nCons: More apps = less battery\n\nI wanted good battery life and this is what the Best Buy guy recommended. The more apps I added, the less my battery held up, even when the apps were closed. I guess I should have expected that.

So many features, super high specs, will be the first phone to get updates, easy to get accessories, large and brilliant display, and plenty of space for your 1,000 apps. The 13MP camera is one of the best on the market but without a better image stabilizer of the G2 or the higher resolution of the Lumia 1020 it isn't necessarily \"the best\". Battery is much better than any other phone I've had and after heavy use for 2 months now I can go 18 hours playing games, listening to music, and texting without having to worry about the charger and my battery manager says that at 99% it can go 3 days with slight use. The white is sleek and stylish without looking dingy too quickly and doesn't show finger prints. The physical button on the front takes some getting used to if you're coming from an older android device with a touch home button. All and all a terrific phone and I would recommend it to even the stingiest of Iphone users.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Great all in one organizer\n\nCons: battery won't last long if you use all the cool features.\n\nNice phone overall. But I did have some problems with it.\nSome apps suddenly stopped while I was using them, it restarted by it self and the screen would blink at times. Fortunately I bought the protection plan when I got my phone. The technician told me that these problems can be caused by some apps, so they had to reset the phone to the factory version to erased all the content given that some apps can't be erased completely just by uninstalling them. So I lost some pictures and phone numbers that I did not saved in the ad card or my Google account.", "Pros: Learning new things all the time.\n\nCons: Can't see that good in daylight.\n\nI really like this phone.

Easy to use, but need more explanation of the apps installed.", "Pros: Good apps, Good Graphics, Nice size screen, Easy to use\n\nCons: Ringers, Ringers, Ringers - Volume\n\nThis is a good phone with one exception and that may be major depending on your needs and use of the phone. The phone is neat and has good default apps and more available. After using a Garmin GPS for may years, the phone GPS is less quality but may be great for someone who does not have a GPS at all. By the way, I compared it side-by-side to my Garmin and only saw minimal differences regarding directions. The differences were minor. My biggest issue with this phone is with the ringer volume, I have missed many calls because when in an area with any significant noise lever, the ringers (and I have tried several) cannot be heard. Yes, the volume was maxed. If I could get a little more volume on the ringers, 4 or 5 stars easily.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: able to watch online movie\n\nCons: phone froze sometimes\n\nmy phone works properly, but some time it froze on me when i talk on the phone and it also gets hot.", "Pros: Great screen and good pictures\n\nCons: User interface on some features. Too many steps to perform a task. Needs more work.\n\nGreat phone, but Samsung fell short on several aspects. I had an HTC Evo and now this. To make a phone call is so cumbersome. Too many steps to make a call. Evo was much simpler. Love the screen size for watching videos, but find myself using two hands to do most functions s'o 'it could be a bit over sized for most day to day features. But dealing with it. Not a major thing for me. Another annoying feature is the extra steps it takes to turn on/off flash in camera mode. Wish there was a button on the screen for that instead of having to go into the menu. Also when taking video for the first time in an area where there is wifi and you are not connected it stops your recording to ask if you want to connect. Have missed several good opportunities to record my daughter because of th'is interruption. Annoying. One last this is the messaging is a bit slow, not sure if that is a Sprint issue or phone issue. The phone feels cheap/fragile, but I use an otterbox protector and love it. Makes it feel a bit sturdier/protected. Overall it's a good phone, but falls short on several issues. If fixed it would be an awesome phone. Hopefully they are resolved in the next gen.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: The look is great\n\nCons: Still learning\n\nWanted a great phone. Had a flip phone and felt out of the loop. Now I am taking pictures, texting and having a fun time.", "Pros: Everything\n\nCons: Nothing so far\n\nI am an Apple person. I have an Ipod, an Ipad, and i love it. This is where Apple doesn't win. Maybe it's just my opinion, but I find this phone so much better than the Iphone. Maybe if you don't have an Ipod or an Ipad, you need an Iphone for the apps and itunes, but then the screen is too small.

Did have some issues at first because I had an iPad linked to my iPhone, so had some issues with getting text messages on the new samsung phone", "I decided to switch from apple just to try something different. I got it in store while it was on sale so it was free besides the new upgrade fee that Verizon charges. As soon as I saw it I absolutely loved this phone! At first it felt like a tablet in my hand compared to the iPhone. The keyboard is hard to get used to but the swipe feature is really cool. The battery life for this phone is not that great. With heavy use it lasts me all day but it's at like 2% when I plug it in. Overall this is a great phone with really amazing features", "Pros: I can see time and date easily\n\nI had a Motorola phone for approximately 2 years, suddenly the battery life was horrible and would not last past 4 hours. I chose this Samsung due to it still being Android, the large screen and the \"back button\" capability that the iphone does not offer. Other features are great!", "Love the features but I had this phone for less then 24 hours and my son accidently knocked it off the coffee table (which is only roughly 2 feet if not less) and the screen broke/cracked. I switched from an iPhone and had the same one for 2 years. I dropped it too many times to count from a lot higher distance then that and nothing ever happened to it. I went to return/exchange it at Best Buy Where I Purchased it And They Told Me No. Now I have to pay a deductible to get a new one which may do the same thing all over again.

I spend countless hours on the Internet, and this had it all! Big screen,speed, and it's user friendly. However, if you drop it, it's history. I've had it 1 month and dropped it (not from a long distance either) and it broke internally. No scratches, it's in a case, no external damage; just a crack on the inside and it won't turn on. So it's back to the store to buy another one for $150 deductible.

I've wanted to chuck my old one out the window soo many times! The g4 is soo smooth and quick! I love the hover sensor that can tell where my finger's resting. I can read a bit of a text without opening it! When I'm reading it knows not to turn off, or when I'm laying sideways it won't rotate the screen. I could go on for a while talking about how cool all the little things are the phone does. I'll just sum it up saying it is the coolest phone ever!

The display is simply gorgeous, very pocketable, extremely fast, magnificent camera, perfect connectivity. The audio quality is truly impressive with the speaker, but even more so when you plug in headphones, very loud and crystal clear and it's the only Android device that beats the iPhone in the audio department. I was pretty loyal to Apple for quite sometime, I'm totally smitten now, by far the best device on the market. My only complaint is that software updates are a bit delayed. The camera is very capable of clear and warm images and videos are smooth.", "Pros: Efficient and multi-tasking\n\nCons: Not that easy to learn to navigate\n\nAt first I didn't want to purchase it because of its size...still getting used to the large phone, but I'm glad I did.

If you live in a bad reception area I would get the iphone as I cant call out 1/3 of the time where I live.", "Pros: Lightweight, nice camera\n\nCons: Size is a little large\n\nGreat phone for the money. I now see why this product has been rated so favorably against the i-phone", "Pros: multi tasking a snap!\n\nI have two samsung galaxy phones (s3 & s4) and I convinced my mom to get the note phone and my boyfried the s4 all within the last year because this product is the best on the market right now. I love it and look forward to the next new galaxy product.", "Pros: Meets all my needs\n\nCons: nothing\n\nSo far this phone has met all my needs. It was easy to learn how to use it having had androids in the past. The ability to expand the memory on this phone was what drew me to it and there has plenty of room for all my apps even without the expansion disk. I use my phone for business and pleasure and have not found it lacking in any way. Its easy to read on and large enough to type on, much lighter to carry than my evo.", "Pros: It does just about everything I can do with my computer.\n\nCons: Batter could last longer but that's what it is like with all cell phones.\n\nThis phone is like caring around a small computer. It does just about everything I can do with my computer and in some cases more.", "Pros: huge screen, android interface\n\nCons: nothing so far\n\nI got this phone for free with a 2 year contract during Black Friday, so the price was unbeatable! I wanted a phone with a great camera and the S4 fits the bill. Phone looks great, the black color has a carbon fiber look on the back of it which I think is very cool. It is very slim but is a bit on the big side (width and height) so if you wear tight jeans or have small pockets this phone may be a bit big. On the flip side though the screen is nice and big, perfect for apps and internet browsing, and viewing pictures/video that you've taken. I haven't used the phone too much yet but so far haven't had any problems. seems like a great phone so i hope it lasts for a long time.", "Pros: Size of screen\n\nCons: Hard to understand how to use. Took me 3 weeks to figure out how to get voice messages.\n\nTaking way to long to figure out how to utilize all this phone has to offer. I have yet to figure it all out.", "Pros: sleek, light weight same time it does not compromise screen size\n\nCons: No sim card, cant make international calls\n\nsleek, light weight and big screen size unlike apple.\nTook excellent pictures with build-in camera, no need of carrying camera anymore.", "Pros: Everything\n\nCons: Nothing\n\nMy son has always had Apple products and wanted to try something new when getting his first smart phone. He's been very happy with the choice of the Galaxy.", "Pros: large screen, expandable memory, multi-function\n\nCons: battery life is limited when using features, good when just on stand-by, but that's not what a smart phone is for.\n\nWorks well as both a phone and handheld browser. Battery life could use some improvement. Runs itself down in less than 12 hrs when using the browser function for anything more than an hour or two.", "Pros: Screen Size\n\nCons: sound not always great\n\nWhen receiving call, the sound sometimes is very high pitched & hard to understand. Turn volume down, it helped a little, but quality should be better for the price of phone.", "Pros: IT WAS FREE WITH A NEW VERIZON ACTIVATION\n\nCons: PHONE NO LONGER WORKED AFTER 1ST 2 WEEKS\n\nMy first time buying a smart phone and the phone was pretty easy to learn how to operate. However at the end of the 2nd week of activating the phone it no longer works as I started my Christmas vacation and was excited to get to take lots of photos with this phone. Well guess it was better it died at the beginning of my vacation or I would have lost all my vacation photos. I went to a Best Buy store in Orlando Florida to see what could be done and the Mobile service dept. said to call the Samsung Mobile number to see about returning it for repair or replacement. I called Samsung and they sent me a prepaid shipping label to return the phone, which i did on December 30,2013. As of today January 5,2014 the online repair status shows it is still open and they have not received the phone. i do realize these are holiday weeks and there may be closed at times but it is really frustrating going on two weeks now with no cell phone to use and still have to pay Verizon over $100.oo for services not being used. If Samsung has known of issues related to my phone then they had better seek a quick remedy with the software they use. I would be even more furious if I had to pay any amount to get this Samsung Galaxy s4 when I signed up with Verizon!!\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: I'm very pleased with pretty much everything about the phone.\n\nCons: I wish the home key was not a key that you have to press. I wish it would have been a tap key, like the back key.\n\nI'm very pleased with my decision to purchase a Samsung. I purchased a Note last year, so I was familiar with operating the device.", "Pros: Screen Size, color clarity\n\nWould recommend this product. Very easy to use & navigate.\nScreen size is perfect & still capable of being put in your pocket even with an Otter Box protecting it.\nScreen colors are awesome.", "Pros: None\n\nMy phone volume got decreased drastically, so most of the time I need to put phone in speaker or headset, otherwise not able to hear properly. Also suddenly losing youtube volume, and need to restart phone every time. Really it is very bad experience for me.", "Pros: Easy to Use, Battery Life, Screen Clarity\n\nCons: Nothing so far\n\nI had the S4 at my last job and when it was time to upgrade my personal phone I chose the Samsung S4. It is easier to use out of the box than an iPhone and the battery life is great. I love the screen, it's a good size to read email and clarity is good. The camera and video are great also.", "Pros: Zero cost thanks to Black Friday. Screen/picture quality is awesome.\n\nCons: Sound is tinny for calls.\n\nMuch better than the S2 it replaced. Zero cost made it a no brainer to upgrade. Sound quality for calls is somewhat lacking though.", "Pros: Ease if use and screen size.\n\nCons: Sound quality for calls.\n\nThis is a great phone. Much better than my S2. Upgraded for free during black Friday sale. Glad I did!!", "Pros: clear graphics\n\nCons: how to use it\n\nAsked BB guy specifically about the instructions on using this thing and he said they were great. Yeah, what planet is he on? There is less than 1/2 page of instructions. How do I talk and use web at same time (the info on that little page was useless)? Have trouble getting calls to go through, sometimes takes 3 tries to get that little beep that means it's going to make the call within 15 seconds. Photo gallery harder to manage than my Droid. Camera much more finicky than Droid. Won't accept my Facebook ID or password, so that's inoperable. Do like the intuitive keyboard and clear graphics. Size is OK. Call clarity same as before.", "Pros: large screen, expandable memory, multi-function\n\nCons: battery life is limited when using features, good when just on stand-by, but that's not what a smart phone is for.\n\nWorks well as both a phone and handheld browser.

The camera takes great quality pictures. The phone, as well as the Verizon 4G network, are brilliantly fast. The screen size was convenient for photo and video, which I use my phone for the most. My only complaint would be the battery life, which was about 10 hours with average usage. Other than that, LOVE this phone!", "Pros: Camera is great\n\nCons: Short batt life drops calls lots\n\nI think it could be the carrier but this phone drops calls doesn't stay charged for a full day.

It was a huge step up from her google nexus but not so much of a leap from my S3.", "Pros: Bigger size, good price\n\nCons: Use chrome for browsing not IE\n\nNo regrets buying Samsung Galaxy S4, scrolling the browser when there are more pages is little slow compared to the previous android phone that I had, minor problem though.", "Pros: Easy to use, Takes great pics\n\nCons: A little large\n\nThis phone does it all. I use a lot of apps for all of my needs and they are easy to load and use. The screen is large and easy to see.", "Pros: Good Phone big Screen\n\nCons: Still working on figuring out all the options\n\nSamsung S4 Phone was bought during a sale so for the price of free I highly recommend it but for $749 i am not as positive", "Pros: User friendly and very fast\n\nScreen is GORGEOUS and processor is FAST! I really like the voice command and air view settings, too. Battery life IMO is comparable to all the other phones out there. I use the power saving setting and turn off the gps & bluetooth when I don't need them. No problems with linking bluetooth and speaker phone is great. Speakers are loud without muffling.\n\nMy favorite thing about Android platforms is that you can customize your screens to which apps you use frequently and the addition of widgets as well. Not to mention a lot of the popular apps that are free!\n\nOverall a very nice phone and the battery life is really better compared to the previous ones", "Pros: Better than iphone\n\nCons: ITS GREAT\n\nFor all those iphone owners, my daughter thought she wanted an iphone....Samsung out performs iphone 10 to 1.

Get it If you're thinking about it.", "Pros: sound phone, good camera, overall a better replacement.\n\nCons: not all highly tooted features work\n\nReplacing my HTC Inspire, I find the HTC a little easier to use. Protected my samsung with an otter box which might be why not all features work. Voice control, when in certain apps, is cool. The scroll down and look away features never seemed to work. Sharing files worked once, might have something to do with music, but video worked, but music would be my most shared item. Television controls was difficult to find but once found is a great feature. Needed to download app for flashlight. Camera takes good pictures but I haven't used all the camera features yet. All in all it is a sound smart phone, I washed a couple of samsung flip phones before and they worked afterward so I needed to try this one, but as much as I wanted this phone and its features I was disappointed but would still lean towards this phone again.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Big screen and plenty of features\n\nCons: It's heavy\n\nPurchase this phone at Best Buy and the customer service was excellent way better than going to Verizon. Now for the phone, the size is a bit big but you get used to it. The features that come with it are great. The only thing I miss from my LG android is the camera. Images with the LG did look better to me.", "Pros: Set up is a breeze, great apps\n\nCons: N/A\n\nGot this phone for my wife as a replacement for a HTC Evo. she loves it. She not a gadget person , but set this one up with no help from me. She likes the camera because she loves taking pictures. She's happy, I'm happy.", "Pros: camera, stored, battery life\n\nI've been waiting to get this phone since it first came out I just wasn't ready for upgrade at work. When I was able to upgrade I bought the Note 3 thinking it was the S4 and more but I brought it back within 48 hours and decided i was just going to wait for the S5, then BB had the S4 for free on black Friday. That was awesome. This phone doesn't disappoint in any way for me and this is actually my first taste of 4G since my S2 and carrier was supposed to have 4G it never did. I went ahead and got an otterbox on it since I've seen how easy the screens break with a simple drop. This phone does make my life better, simply put. Would recommend and have recommended to many.", "Pros: Big screen and plenty of features\n\nCons: It's heavy\n\nPurchase this phone at Best Buy and the customer service was excellent way better than going to Verizon.

Get it If you're thinking about it.", "Pros: Everything! switched from iPhone and never going back.\n\nCons: Can't seem to get all the cool features to work. Air gestures etc. Maybe it's just me.\n\nAs an apple user this was my first Android device. I had no idea what I was missing! Galaxy S4 makes my old iPhone look like a blackberry!! I have just barely scratched the surface of what this device can do. With all the technology packed into the S4 I am confident it will still be relevant when it's time to upgrade again in 2 years.", "Pros: the camera and photo quality, battery life, easy to use\n\nCons: so far so good\n\nVery user friendly.

No complaints so far.", "Pros: potential to do so much, like a pocket computer\n\nCons: nothing\n\nAwesome phone that in many ways has replaced my laptop for daily use. Use it for almost everything, internet, pics, gps, all types of entertainment.", "Pros: 1080p screen 5 inch display light extendable memory full of features really good camera fastest android\n\nCons: At the moment I can't find any negatives about the handset, perhaps the fact that I can't put it down is a negative.\n\nThe Apple iPhone 5S was not even in the running with this phone (and I own an iPhone 4S). There is no getting away from the fact that this phone has more hype surrounding it than any Android device that has preceded it. Fortunately, Samsung has backed up much of this anticipation with action, offering a well-rounded, extremely powerful device that, although lacking something on the aesthetical front, is sure to impress.\n\nGiven the Samsung Galaxy S4\u2019s near identical looks to the S3 and the somewhat run of the mill hardware updates, some will argue that the handset is more of a Samsung Galaxy S3S in the vein of Apple\u2019s incremental updates than a true S3 successor. In truth and practice, however, the handset is a whole new beast and one which far outstrips what has been, until now at least, the world\u2019s most successful Android smartphone.\n\nRemovable back for removable battery, micro SD slot for upgradeable memory, inoffensive TouchWiz interface, and extremely fast, fast, fast.. And Best Buy's price of $0.00 on Black Friday could not be beat! Extremely happy with my purchase!!!\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: all around great product\n\nThis was am upgrade from the iPhone for my teen daughter,she was reluctant to make the move but made the decision solely based on features and capabilities. She's since found so much more that she can do above and beyond the reasons she originally choose to switch.", "Pros: Easy to set up, good price\n\nCons: Nothing so fat\n\nI bought this phone for my mother-in-law for christmas and she loves it.

The shipping from bestbuy.com was fast.", "Pros: Universal remote\n\nCons: Accessories to a minimum\n\nThis is a great phone for but I now want Note 3. So I am giving to my wife, but I bought it for her anyway", "Pros: good size for my larger hands\n\nCons: haven't had time to notice anything bad yet\n\npreviously had an iphone but the screen was too small for my larger hands. this phone is much better.", "Pros: Screen clarity...lots of options (maybe too many)\n\nCons: Camera not as good as thought...short battery life\n\nA great alternative to the iPhone...lots of screen options (maybe too busy)...great self teaching videos available", "Pros: camera is great\n\nCons: gorilla glass screen did not live up to it's expectations.\n\ngreat phone with the exception of the durability of the gorilla glass screen.

The games are different but fun.", "Pros: All the phones features\n\nCons: Nothing\n\nI got this phone for my wife. It took a little getting used to as she had an iPhone before this. She really likes it.", "Pros: Has everything I need. Actually more than I need.\n\nCons: Some apps that I do not want cannot be deleted\n\nMy previous phone was the Samsung S2 which I was very pleased with and would have kept except for the offer of a free S4 during Black Friday at Best Buy. I was considering the LG G2, but finally decided to stay with Samsung because of its replaceable battery and some questions raised on LG G2 connectivity issues with Sprint LTE. The Samsung S4 LTE performance has been outstanding so far.\n\nMy only complaint is the inability to uninstall some preinstalled apps that I have no need for and do not want. That is only reason for 4 stars instead of 5.", "Pros: slim design.... solid feel...got it for free with upgrade...\n\nCons: loded with to much bloatware ...\n\nI chose the S4 because of the look and memory capability.......loaded with great features and fast responses.....", "Pros: Everything works easily\n\nCons: So far, so good\n\nThe sales guy at the store showed me all the phones that I had exprtessed intertest in, and shared the advantages and features of each. He let me narrow my choices to the S4, and it has proven to be a great choice. I get much better battery life and better reception in weak areas than my old LG, and get a lot more features that have become quite useful at work, at home, and out and about. I recommend the S4 at Best Buy.", "Pros: picture quality is very good and I can multi task with it.\n\nCons: Since it's a touch screen it auto correct is my problem.\n\nI love my new phone, taught it was going to be too big at first but am really loving it. Thanks to best buy too for a great sale. I could not have been happier.", "Pros: Great price and has all the bells and whistles\n\nCons: No cons that i can find yet\n\nLove the phone.

I was looking for a new phone since my contract was up. This is my second smart phone. First was a Samsung Stratosphere. Not bad for a first phone, but I underestimated how much I would use it. I quickly outgrew that old phone and had to stick with it for two years. Now I have a phone that does more than I could imagine. Many times faster and more intuitive. Awesome phone, no complaints.", "Pros: It's very easy to use\n\nI am coming from having apple 5 c and this phone is the best you don't have to pay for anything you have so many free app to choose from and this phone can talks to read you the news read your texts it also tell you who is calling and it makes calls you would have to download the app and its free i love free I love this phone...", "Pros: Almost everything\n\nCons: bluetooth does not automatically connect to my cars bluetooth\n\nOver all the phone is great but does not automatically connect to my cars bluetooth hands free.

The screen size is very nice for browsing, much better than what iphone has.", "Pros: Super skinny, good battery life\n\nCons: Breaks easily, don't ever drop\n\nLove the phone, skinny, perfect size, great battery life. Great camera also. Not very durable though, seen my friends break theirs very easily, get a case or don't ever drop it.", "Pros: Great Android phone\n\nCons: Battery life\n\nPretty good phone. Easy setup. Got an Otterbox Defender series case to go with it. Expect to recharge every 1.5 days for relatively low usage....daily for higher usage.", "Pros: It's a big upgrade from my old phone, HTC Evo 4G\n\nCons: It's kind of big\n\nI love this phone. Way better than my old phone, HTC Evo 4G. Like all the features and the battery life is awesome!", "Pros: Fits just right in your hand, unlimited music app for 10 a month, great price\n\nCons: Battery life but it's understandable because there's do much you can do\n\nI love the phone, love the price. It was just a score when I got it", "Cons: Paying for the service...lol\n\nThe phone is very fast and has a lot of features that I'll probably never learn to use them all or take advantage of, but other than that I love it.

I needed to replace my S3 since it only worked on speaker (following my accidentally dunking it!) but didn't want to spend a lot. This was $0 when I renewed my contract. Perfect! I really like the phone better too.", "Pros: Everything worked well - decent battery life\n\nCons: Phone completely died a little over a month after I got it\n\nPhone died completely after having it only a bit over a month. Apparently no fix for it - so now I have to go without a phone until a replacement arrives. Very inconvenient - and not thrilled that I will probably get a refurbished phone to replace a practically brand new one.", "Pros: great phone. great service.\n\nUpgraded from s3. The s4 is just the next logical step in the Galaxy s line. The cameras great. The screen colors are bright and clear. And the Verizon network is great! 4G every where!", "Pros: Picture. Easy to learn. Long battery life.\n\nCons: Nothing yet.\n\nI got this phone for $49 during the holidays. It was between this and the Note 3. I just didn't feel like having a 1\" bigger screen was worth $100 more. I don't watch movies on my phone, that's what my tv is for. Anyhow, great phone!", "Pros: everything....\n\nCons: haven't found a downside to this phone yet\n\nExcellent product....great pics and function...went from the iphone to this phone and was skeptical & am completely happy with this purchase!", "Pros: Fits just right in your hand, unlimited music app for 10 a month, great price\n\nCons: Battery life but it's understandable because there's do much you can do\n\nI love the phone, love the price.

There is obviously a huge difference between them. The expanded specs makes running currents easier and faster. Unfortunately, the only complaint I have so far is the bloat ware that comes with the phone. I glad you at least have the option to disable the in the app manager. So far there haven't been any complaints so far. Though I haven't had it for a month yet.", "Pros: Nothing I can think of\n\nCons: Too many apps you can't delete that you'll never use\n\nTraded in my iPhone 4S for this because I heard so many great things about it. But with trying to customize it to my needs, I am terribly disappointed. First, the data usage is killing me! I have to turn off everything to keep from running over my monthly allotment . Secondly when I try to talk on the phone, I accidentally hang up on people with my cheek! Can't talk to everyone on speaker! I shouldn't have to. The dang apps that I'll never use but can't get rid of is a pain. Finally, just when I was beginning to get the hang of it, the crazy thing flat out died in the middle of a conversation. Battery was fully charged at the time. Ever the Samsung rep couldn't turn the darn thing back on to save my contacts, pictures, settings or purchased apps, so I has to start over from scratch with nothing. So sorry I switched from Apple.

The s beam is also cool to share quick data with some one", "Pros: Camera and large screen, clear\n\nCons: Slippery without phone cover\n\nDo not like the new way to form contacts, limited information allowed.

Easy to navigate and gets great signal.\n\nI bought this phone for my wife and she absolutely loves it. She had a choice between this and new iPhone and she chose this phone.

THIS IS A GREAT PHONE AND IVE HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH IT SINCE I BOUGHT IT.", "Pros: Ease of use\n\nCons: call volume\n\nGreat all around phone. Could use more ear volume. Takes a little adjustment of settings to take good pictures. But once set you're good to go", "Pros: Large 5-inch display, Video Capture Quality\n\nCons: Warnings about scratches, so get good screen protector,case\n\nThis replaced my very old Motorola razr phone. It has a very good large display that even I (with my bad eyesight) can read. I had no problems configuring my e-mail on it. I am very pleased with sound quality, picture quality, cameras. It wirelessly connects to my home network when I am home for data usage (thus saving on my Verizon wireless data usage). Most impressed with video quality while recording home video on it. Better than camcorders, lightweight, etc. It also accepts microSD memory card add-ons. I added 64GB to store pictures and music on mine.

Apps load quickly, but they crash fairly often. The battery lasts about a day before needing to be recharged. It's about the size of a scientific calculator, so it's pretty awkward to talk on unless it's on speaker.", "Pros: A lot of options\n\nCons: battery dies pretty quicky, apps run in background (constantly shutting them off to save battery)\n\nSprint network is HORRIBLE!!!!! Took phone into Best Buy after a day and it already needed an update that was only available in person at the Samsung kiosk. BTW...the associates at these kiosks are TERRIFIC! Phone freezes when in text mode constantly. I remove battery and reboot an average of 8-10 times per day. Lots of great apps and features BUT not sure they are worth the headache. I upgraded from the III and that was worse.", "Pros: battery life, screen size/resolution, tough\n\nI went from the S2 to the S4 and there is no comparison. All of the good from my old phone is in this phone, plus it has what seems to be twice the battery life. It has a big beautiful screen. Texts and emails are easy to read. Movies look unbelievable and haven't noticed any issues with streaming of video or music, etc.", "Pros: camera\n\nCons: sound quality while using the phone\n\nSo far so good. Worst shopping experience of my life at Best Buy. Will go to a Sprint store for my next upgrade.", "Pros: the ability to customize just about everything\n\nAwesome phone. Have had it for a month and still discovering new features. Got it free Thanksgiving weekend. Love the phone.", "Pros: great overall function\n\nCons: not great for people with smaller hands\n\nI purchased this phone shortly after the Thanksgiving holiday. I didn't realize how large the phone was until i got it home and put an otter box case on it! Other than size, I am fairly happy with the phone.", "Pros: huge screen, quick, great camera\n\nCons: battery life is not great if you are running a lot of apps\n\nI had an iPhone and decided to go with something with a bigger screen. Glad I did because it is great!", "Pros: eye and hand motions, hands free features and so much more\n\nCons: battery life\n\nthis phone is a great value for the price there are tons of features that allow you to surf the web without your hands by just using your eyes and by hoovering your hand over the screen to flip through different website pages simultaneously. The battery life is okay if you don't do a lot on your phone during the day but if you are like me and you use it for practically everything from surfing the web for logging on to various web sites thank you will need to charge the phone at least once during the day.

I don't care about frills if the phone itself does not function. It randomly froze or lagged. Also, I dropped it six inches off the ground and the screen cracked. I've dropped my old iPhone from higher lengths and nothing happened to the screen.\n\nIf it actually worked, I'd still be using it.\n\nWent back to iPhone and couldn't be happier.", "Pros: Works well, does everything\n\nCons: Can be complicated to use some things\n\nI upgraded to the S4 for Droid X and the difference is unbelievable. This phone does everything I can think of trying to do on a phone and it does it well.", "Pros: Easy to set up, offers customization\n\nCons: Service is not good, Battery life is moderate, Group message downloads\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S4 is great. It had great functionality in regards to customization, touch screen options, etc. the photo quality is amazing. However, Sprint's service is very poor in this area. Cannot get service in many locations. Additionally, the group messaging functionality can be frustrating as you have to wait for texts to download. Lastly, while on call, it can sometimes be difficult to navigate to the home screen to view the internet/texts/etc.", "Pros: Price\n\nCons: Freezing sometimes,\n\nJust enough for my busy life, keep me connected with all world. Love it, maybe just like all smart phones have a problems with dropping calls, freezing in lease expecting times. Overall I love it.", "Pros: fits right into my hand\n\nCons: Should come with detailed brochure re how to use all features\n\nThis phone does everything. Needed to have larger than normal phone so that keyboard would be easier to use. Former phone was Blackberry and keyboard was too small for my fingers. Fact that all calls can be answered hands free, including name of caller is so convenient.", "Pros: It does anything you can think of and more.\n\nCons: The battery life is very short and apps stay open in the background even after I close them, especially the Internet.\n\nI love all of the new features and how easy it is to use everything.

At that price, this phone was a no brainer. I'll start with the good aspects and then work toward the parts that I don't enjoy.\n\nAs with all LTE phones, there is a lot of battery consumption. Where I work there is little signal strength. This phone does however get more signal strength than my old phone, a Galaxy Nexus. The ability to remove and replace the battery is a tremendous plus. The battery lasts almost the entire day. If I worked somewhere with decent signal, or worked a regular work day I would not have needed the spare battery.\n\nThe screen is amazing. I have never seen a screen this crisp. It looks great while viewing pictures, watching movies, or even just playing with apps.\n\nThis is a speedy phone. I have not been able to slow it down or make it stutter...even with the bloatware running (I'll talk about this later.\n\nThe camera has put my sony digital camera to shame. I have stopped carrying it because of this phone. I wish it had an optical zoom, but none of the phones do yet. I have had people with Iphones be impressed by the picture quality from my phone.\n\nOn the downside, there is a bunch of Samasung apps, or bloatware installed. So much so that if you don't purchase an SD card, you wont have much room for apps, pictures etc. Out of the onboard 16 GB, about 10-12 of it came used before I started using it. At least memory cards are cheap and this phone has a slot. I look at the SD card slot as a positive as my previous phone did not have one.\n\nCompounding the bloatware issue is the inability to uninstall the software or even to disable it. Some of the software superceeds the google version (for instance when you want to do a google search by voice from a headset, you get \"S voice\" instead. Some of the apps are just silly. The ability to look away and pause a video? The ability to scroll by moving your eyes? These are gimicky and don't always work based on camera and back li ...\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Love the Large Screen\n\nCons: Nothing\n\nTraded my Iphone 4 for S-4 loved it from the minute I opened the box, I loved the phone. Battery Life is great, The apps are exactly whatI was looking for. Great Phone!", "Pros: Lots of features and easy to use\n\nCons: Haven't found it yet\n\nEasy to use, lots of features, simple yet has everything needed to call, connect and communicate", "Pros: 13 mp camera, Air view & gesture, Infra red remote, Fast processor\n\nCons: Quality of material\n\nI don't know where to start when talking about how great this phone is. You can answer a call or scroll when browsing the internet without touching the screen (in case your hands are messy from eating). How cool is it that there is an option which allows the phone to operate as a remote. This phone also takes better pictures than some of the digital cameras out on the market.", "Pros: Display\n\nCons: the case\n\nI love my phone...I prefer it over the iPhone for display and function. The case is a bit flimsy so you need a cover. I use a wallet so it's protected when I'm not using it but thin and small in my hand while using it.", "Pros: Good app selection, lots of cool features\n\nCons: Camera not as good as iphone\n\nI bought this phone primarily for the camera specs that were advertised, but find that the pictures it takes are not as good as that of an iphone.", "Pros: It's purple!\n\nCons: miss some of the ringtones on old phone\n\nHappy with the phone. Unfortunately the transaction disrupted my sprint service for a whole day and the billing was done incorrectly. Had to make several calls to Sprint and Best Buy credit card services to get everything straightened out.", "Pros: big screen, more business focsued\n\nCons: not as user friendly\n\nThis phone is practically a tablet, with the ability to make calls. Camera is amazing and the ability to work on your business documents so easily. The only downfall, is this iphone is not as user firendly. You will have to read it's manual and look for things, because it can do far more than the iphone 5s.", "Pros: What isn't great about it\n\nCons: maybe the battery life\n\nOverall a great phone with a great camera. It has all the apps you can possibly need and for the older crowd, with its slightly larger size, its a lot easier to see what your doing. I will take this over an Iphone all day long.", "Pros: use of apps\n\nCons: nothing\n\nI have a few samsung products including tv and appliances so the phone was an easy choice and when I am eligible for an upgrade I am going to the note 3.", "Pros: operating system is smooth\n\nCons: short battery life\n\nSeems to cover all the right bases.

It is user friendly, and I have not had any dropped calls since I have had this phone.", "Pros: Very responsive, thin, better screen than an iPhone\n\nCons: Too many apps pre-installed that I would never use\n\nI love this smartphone, but with all the preinstalled apps (that I will never use), it drains the battery faster than it should. After disabling many of those apps, my battery life is average.\n\nThe camera produces superb photos and I like the fact that I can take a picture just by saying the word \"shoot\".\n\nI also enjoy the greater flexibility in customizing this phone, as compared to an iPhone. Overall, it's a great value.", "Pros: Stable, fast and good at what I want it to do\n\nCons: Haven't found a flaw yet\n\nI'm so pleased I finally pulled the trigger and got the Galaxy 4. It makes great calls and responds quickly when I need it for navigation, email or short entertainment. It's not locked up on me once.", "Pros: versatility\n\nCons: they are holding back\n\nThis phone rivals the iPhone and wins hands done. The industry as a whole is holding back though, these phones have enough room for TB sized memory let's make it happen.", "Pros: has the best camera\n\nHad a flip phone for so many years I am sorry that I waited so long to get this phone.Sound quality is the best and I love the camera.", "Pros: Touch screen works great.\n\nCons: Battery.

Great screen resolution , and the functionality and customization is ideal for day to day use", "I was a Blackberry user for years, holding off on switching away from them because I didn't want to give up the physical keyboard. The worst part of the new S4 has been learning to use the virtual keyboard, and that is such a small slight against it that it's barely worth mentioning.

I'm happy I got this instead of the iPhone.", "Pros: Easy to understand how to use it, big screen\n\nCons: Hate the steps it takes to call someone\n\nPhone is so thin that I would worry about breaking it if I hadn't bought a sturdy case for it.

I've been a blackberry user for years and finally made a switch when I saw it in PURPLE. What a difference. The only downside is this phone is fragile. My phone fell from about a 2ft or less and not very hard. The result? A hairline crack on the edge of the LCD costing 150 to replace.

The s4 is comparable from a user interface perspective, so it didn't take long for me to figure it out. While camera is finer resolution than my 8mp HTC evo, I don't really see a difference. I do like the ability to take panoramic pics too!\nBlue tooth is clunky...it will remember a pair, but won't stay connected, so I have to manually connect it each time I start my car. Further, it often only connects media and not phone, so I have to sit there trying to check the \"phone\" box multiple times before it will take. Really annoying. Even tried deleting the setup to start over but there is no \"delete\" option.\nUsed kies to import music from iTunes and that works fine for me.\nI use Google maps a lot, since I travel over 100 miles per day.

But once I had the Galaxy S4 in my hands for 1 day I never thought about my iPhone again. The battery life, ease of customization (i.e. no need for iTunes), the large screen and photo quality far surpasses the iPhone in every way. I am a power user and am on my phone at least 8-10 hours per day from email, phone calls, web surfing, note taking, and text messaging.

My favorite Samsung so far. Love all of the capabilities and so east to use!", "Pros: Awesome camera and functionality\n\nCons: Screen cover less than desirable\n\nOnly 20 days old and screen cracked when set on top of a small particle on a desk. The worst part was the Best Buy associate did not inform us of the new insurance policy. So I now have a $150 deductible. I paid more for the phone from Best Buy for their awesome Insurance, but now it its a totally useless service.", "Pros: camera, screen size\n\nCons: texting auto correct is not the quality of iphones\n\nI had owned an iphone and wanted a bigger screen.

They would crash daily, drop calls, random craziness on the touch screens, poor battery life... you name it we've experienced it! We bought the Galaxy S4 expecting similar stuff, but have been pleasantly surprised. The Galaxy S4 has been everything we wanted and more! Couldn't be happier with the purchase and would recommend it to anyone.", "Pros: Very Light Weight; Extremely Clear Screen\n\nCons: The Cases Make It Too Big; Pricey\n\nNot all the features work perfectly on METROPCS.

I do not miss the keyboard of my old Epic like I thought I might.", "Pros: Call clarity, Camera, Processor\n\nCons: Size, but one can get over it quick\n\nThis is my most recent phone upgrade and I am so happy that I went with the Galaxy S4. Having upgraded from the Galaxy S this phone is lightning fast. Being able to open multiple browsers is the most useful feature I have encountered so far. On the galaxy S you could only open a couple of them. Other than that the phone is very solid, all apps that I have downloaded on it have worked great/flawlessly. It's a great phone and well worth the money.", "Pros: Easy to Use and create documents on phone\n\nCons: poor selection of native emoticons\n\nThis phone is 10 times more functional than the iPhone I switched from.

Connections (both WiFi and 4G) are much faster. Battery is still stressed to make it to end of day with all functions on (GPS, bluetooth, 4G, etc).\n\nOverall, I like it. Screen is a little larger than S2 but not too big to fit in your pocket. Bought a separate Seidio case after I dropped the phone in the parking lot. I still prefer to iphone ... after much research.", "Pros: Great price with an easy to use operating system.\n\nCons: N/a\n\nI really enjoy the picture quality this phone offers. The iPhone was good but my samsung had a bigger screen, HD graphics, options to increase my memory size, and more apps!", "Pros: Big screen, excellent picture\n\nCons: Battery life is just ok\n\nWell, if you are looking for a phone that can do just about anything, this one is it. If you use a lot of apps, expect the battery to go down quickly. It is still much better than my old GS2. Takes wonderful pictures and videos. The screen is big and clear and watching videos are very clear. Sound is really good also. Definitely a larger phone also, but with big hands it is no big deal.", "Pros: Large screen and clear as a bell\n\nCons: Couldn't transfer my apps\n\nAfter owning the iphone I was afraid to switch but the screen on the new iphone 5S just wasnt big enough.

I decided to get out of my comfort zone and go for the Samsung Galaxy S4.\nThe S4 is a major step up to a whole new world of mobile technology!\nFor those who need an increased level of technology and productivity, the Samsung Galaxy S4 is an excellent choice!\nI chose to purchase an extended battery which gave my S4 much more life without having to recharge. The extended battery came with a durable non slip back. The original back of the S4 will no longer fit with the extended battery. The new back will make the phone a little heavier and thicker but the grip is far better. This is a good investment for those who must use their phone often and can't afford to stop and charge. I can use my phone now for about 3 days without a charge!\nThere are many exciting features to discover with all the latest upgrades. It synced perfectly with my new car!\nI highly recommend the Galaxy S4, without reservation, to anyone who is serious about business, exploring a higher level of technology, security, versatility and want to graduate to a phone you can depend on. Great job, Samsung!\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: is extremely fast\n\nthis is by far the best phone that I have ever owned, it has yet to crash, in very compact to fit in my shirt pocket.

Also very excited about the group texting upgrade from the S3.\n\nCons: Battery life is better than the S3, but still leaves a bit of room for improvement.\n\nI upgraded from the S3 and for the most part it has been a happy experience. I love being able to group text with my misguided I-phone friends. My only real complaint is battery life. Most days it is great but there are random days on which the battery drains extremely quickly for no apparent reason. There doesn't appear to be anything extra running and I'm not using it any more than normal. Weird... Swype also seems to be better on the S4 as opposed to the S3.

I like being able to check email and go on the internet. A big step up from my previous phone", "Pros: Phone features\n\nCons: Drop calls\n\nI truly enjoy my new phone. I'm glad I made the upgrade and stuck with Bestbuy. I love the customer service in the Waldorf and the perks of the reward system. The shield is a bonus because it definitely stops the scratches. The case cover is awesome. I received many compliments!!!", "Pros: Amazing features, Great and Bright screen\n\nCons: Not for small hands, weird battery life (depending on charger)\n\nIt takes awhile to get through all the features of the phone. My fav. is the device while driving feature where the phone actually reads out the messages to you. You then have the option to call/send messages virtually hands free through dictation! The phone can pick up my southern accent and I don't have to repeat words. With this phone I rarely use my laptop. It comes with it's own version of a word document processor.

I charge this phone more than my 4yr old iPhone 4 that is still using its original 4yr old battery. I have read reviews of turning of settings to extend battery life so I have done that, I even went to the Samsung department in Best Buy and had them go trough the phone to have it run with the best battery life settings. Still less charge time than my iPhone. I am at the point that I have all the features off and I go in and manually turn them on to use them just so I have enough battery to get me though the day, It is a bit of a hassle. If the phone sets unused from a full charge at the end of the day I will have about 15% battery life left. UNUSED!\n\nThe folks at best buy said that my short battery life is due to the phone being used on the Sprint network. Even though it should last more than a day.\n\nMy second biggest grips is I own a Jawbone Bluetooth and it sounds very garbled on this phone sometimes to the point you can not make out what people are saying. I have no idea what is causing it or if there is a setting to fix it. but by default it sounds horrible.\n\nSo it is a good phone with tons of cool features, but if your going to purchase this phone get an extra or larger battery for it.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: speed color ease of use\n\nCons: probably be outdated in 10 months or so\n\nTop quality, lots of features, learning something new everyday, screen has to best in class if not right at the top, definitely an upgrade", "Pros: I like the battery life and photo quality\n\nCons: Nothing so far.\n\nGood phone and easy to use.

I've had two generations of IPhones and wanted to try the Samsung to be different. The phone is infinitely customizable with the different screens you swipe through.

They're not even in the same league. When typing, the letters that are displayed are not the intended letters unless you go Very slowly. The phone does not auto-correct misspelled/ mis-typed words like the iPhone. The swipe-to-text feature is kind of neat, but in my opinion a novelty because it is way too slow.

I previously had the original Galaxy S phone, and I was hesitant to switch because I really loved the slide out keypad. I had another phone prior to the Galaxy S that did not have the keypad, and it was extremely difficult to text using the touch pad. However, once I began to text using the \"swipe\" feature on the new S4, I was amazed at how fast and accurate it was. I truly love this new phone, and believe me, I was skeptical prior to purchasing it. The camera is absolutely amazing. Hands down the best phone I have ever owned.", "Pros: everything\n\nCons: battery could be a little better\n\nOver all great phone, wish it had more voice commands without having to start s voice, other than that it's great.", "Pros: Large screen, good picture quality, easy to use, fast downloads.\n\nCons: Do not like the headphones too loud warning when I have my aux cord plugged in and want volume turned all the way up.\n\nIn all of my experience regarding phones, every device has come with some sort of frustration. As a man-made production, technology tends to demonstrate many flaws; however, the Samsung Galaxy S4 provides the maximal satisfaction compared to any other phone that I have owned.\n\nPhones purchased in the past have always froze up or performed slowly. The Galaxy S4 from Samsung rarely freezes up and operates at a very fast speed, a convenient feature that I seek when choosing a new cellular device.\n\nThe large screen appears as another wonderful quality about this phone. Touch screens can be difficult to use at times, especially when the screen is small and the letters are even smaller. This can make reading and writing text very challenging on a touch screen. The Samsung Galaxy S4 also displays a high definition picture, creating the clearest picture of any phone I've owned in the past.\n\nOverall, this phone administers great features with consistent functionality. I highly recommend this device to anyone seeking a new phone.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Very functional and easy to use\n\nCons: Vibrate feature stopped working within 2 months\n\nAll in all good phone.

My former phone was an HTC EVO and my biggest complaints were that it was slow and I continually got \"low on space\" messages, even after transferring as much as possibly to the SD Card. With the S4, downloading is a breeze and there are no annoying \"low on space\" messages. The screen resolution is excellent and the camera is great. I know the EVO was dated so I expected the S4 to be an improvement but, so far, I really like this phone.", "Pros: I love the screen size\n\nCons: Fairly expensive\n\nI switched to this from my original droid X. I like the android system and this phone was very easy for me to learn how to use.", "Pros: Great picture quality, interesting features\n\nCons: Poor battery life, not easy to navigate\n\nLet me preface this by saying that prior to purchasing this phone, I was a former (and current) iPhone user. I did end up returning this phone to Best Buy and keeping my iPhone, but not because of any fault of the Galaxy - I just decided that Android was not for me. On that note, Best Buy made the return process easy and hassle-free. I do not plan on buying another phone elsewhere. That being said....\n\nThe Galaxy was a good phone with a lot of innovative features. I did enjoy the customizability of all of the features - from the saying on the screen to the vibration patterns. I did find that some of the features of the phone had too many options to customize and found this to be a bit overwhelming for someone who is not overly technically savvy. However, the \"easy\" mode is a good fix for this. The display was absolutely stunning and the pictures and colors just seemed to pop. I also really enjoyed the way you can slide across the letters to text. Unfortunately, this method was the only way that I could get the auto correct to recognize what I was trying to type. When I would simply type out the word, the auto correct generally had a hard time trying to figure out what I was trying to say.\n\nThe biggest drawback of the Galaxy S4 was the battery life. I noticed that even when idle, the battery drained quickly. Also, while I enjoyed the large screen, it was almost too large and bulky. (As a female) I could not fit the phone into my pockets and it was almost too large for the cell phone pocket on my purse. It seemed a little unwieldy and I was constantly afraid of dropping it because it was awkward to handle. Additionally, I could not ever get the \"eye scrolling\" feature to work. I found the Kies program to be a little tough to navigate as well.\n\nOverall, the Galaxy S4 was a good phone, but I would not recommend it to someone who has had an iPhone for an extended period of time and who is generally happy with their iPhone or who is used to the way iPhones/iTunes operate. ...\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Camera and graphics\n\nGreat overall phone.

So lightweight the belt clip case I got for ti hangs without being too heavy.", "Pros: Takes great pictures - good quality sound!\n\nCons: Would like longer battery life.\n\nGave my husband my Galaxy S 3 and I purchased the Galaxy S 4.

Have had a number of friends with the iPhone play with the S4 and like it over the phone they were stuck with.", "Pros: number of apps\n\nEasily a great phone hands down. The only issues I have is with the battery and speakers. The battery life while good can easily die if you do not pay a lot of attention to what programs and notifications you have running in the background. Outside of that, the speaker design is not the best. The positioning of the speaker on the bottom back of the phone yields poor sound quality unless you place the screen face down. If you do that, it makes controlling your music difficult unless you have voice control set up.", "Pros: Able to fix pic problems immediately...\n\nCons: Programs run to make it challenging to keep it charged.\n\nThe screen size is just right.

Phenomenal phone. I love it I love it I love it! The camera on both sides is great, and the pix are so clear and crisp. audio is also great for listening to music. This phone is my life.

At first, I regretted my decision, but the more I used it, the more I got used to it. I find that menu navigation isn't quite as intuitive as I'd like it to be, and it takes a little bit to be able to take a great pic (almost all of of them were blurry because I couldn't hit the button right) I am also still getting used to autocorrect options vs the phone just autocorrecting\n\nThe speaker for this phone is on the back, I am not a huge fan of putting my phone face down on anything just to hear it well, I am listening to music, if I put my phone face down while thescreen is still active, it automatically pauses the music, not a deal breaker, but kind of irritating.\n\nOverall, once I got more used to things it became a rreally great phone for me\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Intuitive controls and fully customizable even with the added features\n\nCons: Nothing.\n\nAwesome phone.

While the Galaxy S4 was a nice phone, I never found an ap that would sync with Outlook. Doing Internet research let me know that was correct. I also didn't find an ap to do a complete backup like iTunes did, no automatic Outlook sync. When selecting a contact to be a \"Favorite\" I was unable to find a way to select a specific phone number to allow one-touch dialing. Voice texting was wonderful.

I'm not a big texter like my son's but I really like the texting and typing on this phone much better than the hunt and peck on iPhone. You don't have to lift you finger off the screen when spelling words and it automatically spaces words correctly for you. I think this has better spell check than the iPhone as well. The voice recognition is better than Siri and the automation of the Google maps is great! MICRO SD CARD MEMORY EXPANSION. Your not stuck to whatever is in the phone itself. It takes a micro USB connector so no need to buy overpriced Apple cords.\n\nCONS: There is a learning curve because it is so rich in features. It is not as user friendly as the iPhone, but for those that don't want to take time to learn it has an \"easy\" mode that makes it perfect for non-techies. The camera shutter is not as fast as the iPhone so more photos will come out blurry. Video is decent.\n\nOVERALL: It's larger than the iPhone but not too large and the bigger screen justifies the size.

They're so different and are for different types of users. That said, the S4 is the top of the phones in its type.

However, it was too big for me to hold in my hand. So I traded it for the Samsung Galaxy S4. There is not much difference between the 2 except for the camera is better on the S4, and there is the better swiping..or non-touching of the phone. However, the sensitive swipe can be a problem for people with bigger fingers. The downside is how hot the phone can get if you have a case on it. I have an otterbox slim case on it and it will get hot when I watch videos. It is not so hot that it shuts off, but it may get annoying for some. I believe it is because of the 1.94ghz processor. The battery life is not 100% on my end, but I am sure it is because of the processor. I do have to charge it everyday..sometimes 2 times a day.

I love the features that allow me to make this phone my own. And i LOVE how big the screen is. I can customize the look and the texts. It makes me always want to use my phone. The sound isn't anything spectacular as there is just a little speaker on the back of the phone but it doesnt the job. Also, I sometimes feel the battery doesnt last very long. I had to purchase a car charger to say the least. I've never had a problem with phone reception and the calls are clear as day! I'm very happy with the S4 and would recommend it to others.", "Pros: features\n\nCons: keyboard is super sensitive, short battery life\n\nI like Samsung products and I am overall satisfied with the S4.

With the advancement in software and apps, it is hard to see a speed difference with a quad core processor compared to a single core phone purchased 3 years ago. But the same applies to the PC as well. If you could create a web page with the basics of the 90's and access with a current quad core PC, page load would be instantaneous before you could blink. I have used this phone side by side with a Note II (on T Mobile) and battery run down is even during use with both screens set on full brightness. The difference comes during stand by mode and you will notice a major difference in battery run down with the S4. The Sprint technician conclusion was a bad battery, which was not the case. New battery discharges just as fast in stand by mode. Mind you I have have all of the new Galaxy features turned off. 2nd issue with power consumption is with the recharge speed with the standard issued charger. While in use, the phone is still discharging instead of recharging while connected to the standard charger. Luckily, I had Nokia Rapid Chargers (home and auto) that charges the phone while in use (3 hours max recharge time from 2% charge left on battery). The same issue exist as well if you try to charge via USB from a laptop or desktop. At times, this is a major frustration with the S4. The 1080p screen is excellent for You Tube and Vevo use (and most likely Netflix...I do not use that app). The phone does vibrate for some reason on intial pick up of the phone from a resting position. That is extra power used for no reason. Cannot find the feature to turn off that is activating the gyro on pick up. Camera is excellent for day time use aloing with a icon for swicthing between front and rear cameras.

I will say it's not as intuitive as the Galaxy 2 was for Sprint. Some of the settings take a little time to find. The call quality is very good, and so is the sound quality.

My only gripe if you want to call it that.", "Pros: Call clarity, camera\n\nCons: battery life and battery temperature\n\nI was a bit apprehensive about the overall size of the phone, but it was an easy adjustment. The camera is great as well as the call clarity. The battery life is a bit shorter than I would prefer and the battery heats up with prolonged use or if it is searching for service (or in a roaming area). Also, the ring volume is lower than most phones, so I do find myself missing calls when in more than moderately noisy situations.", "Pros: Processor speed and battery life\n\nCons: Bluetooth volume adjusts on it's own\n\nThe S4 is a good improvement over the S3. The improved battery life and faster processor are the most obvious improvements and most appreciated.

The customer service exceeds the iPhone also.\n\nAdvice to others is to hurry & cross-over!", "Pros: Bigger Screen\n\nCons: Speakers\n\nNothing great about this phone than the Motorola Photon I had. The camera features do not look any different than any other pics I have taken. Lots of useless bells and whistles that most other phones have. So what I can turn my phone on by waving my hand by it. that is pretty much the only thing the Air gesture does. I paid $50 for this phone, after I did a trade in and I used a gift card, so for the price it is a great phone. Would not spend over $100 for this though.", "Pros: excellent camera\n\nCons: almost to large, battery life is just okay\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S4 is hands down the best smartphone on the market.

I like android phones over iPhones for their ease of use. The great thing about the S4 is that it is organized like other android phones. The air gestures and other features are easy to use and give the S4 an original feel. The only thing that is not so great is how sleek and thin the phone is. The S4 pretty big, a plus for me. I thought this was a plus on the phone until I carried it around for a while. Within a week, it slipped out of my hand (I have never dropped a phone before).\n\nEven with this 'downfall' I think the phone is great.

Love it!", "Pros: pic ture quality great, system operates really fast\n\nCons: streaming video, getting set up correctly,\n\nThis phone is good but was over advertised and does not stand up to what I expected in performance. It may be my carrier as I had to change when i got this unit. I am overall very satisfied with the Galaxy S4.", "Pros: Light, thin, fast\n\nCons: Sound quality, Freezes\n\nI really like this phone, but there are a few things that are not so great. I have had my phone for about a month and it has already started acting a little glitchy by freezing. I have to take out the battery to reset it and it's annoying. I also don't like that there is no autocorrect. On my Bionic if I typed \"ths\" it would change it to \"the\" automatically. On this phone it doesn't have that feature. I also don't love the sound quality. When I am listening to Pandora I have to stay right by the phone to hear it - the volume level isn't very high. Overall though I needed an upgrade and this was the best of my options.", "Pros: Everything, very thin & light.\n\nCons: Nothing noted so far\n\nGreat time saver, I am hesitant to call it a phone because that is just one of the things it can do. In my work it saves a lot of time because there is an App for everything you need to do.Wish I had one 20 years ago. Samsung makes a great line of merchandise that I have several pieces of their technology. Keep up the great work.", "Pros: not too big\n\nCons: could always use a longer battery\n\nI enjoy this phone was a legacy galaxy 1 owner and the differences in ease of use are too many to mention", "Pros: I like everything\n\nCons: haven;t found that yet\n\nAs I said above the best phone yet. Picture quality is through the roof, call quality better than any phone I have and out performs my wife's iPhone 4S consistently in low signal areas (like our home). I thought the large form factor would be an issue with it fitting in pockets but I got a tremendous case that's as thin and light as the phone yet protective (Cimo S).\nSo far, I haven't found a problem though I wonder why sometimes the screens is lighted when I pull it out of my pocket. Though I love the feature that keeps the screen lighted while reading it.\nI don't really view many videos but YouTube is great.\nSometimes the battery lasts for two days but normally I just charge it at the end of the day.\n\nHope this helps!\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Large screen(great for GPS), good camera and lots of functions.\n\nCons: Lots of new technology that isn't explained well.\n\nThis is a really nice phone. Large screen, easy to read, fast processor, good sound quality, not too heavy, good battery life( lasts the whole day). I would recommend this phone. There is a lot of breakthrough technology here and the phone is a good value. I wish there were better tutorials. I think I have to go back to Best Buy and find the Samsung expert to fully explain all of the features and how to use them.", "Pros: everything\n\nCons: nothing\n\nI have been extremely happy with the S4. Very long battery life, easy to use (I am not very good with techie stuff). Camera takes great pics.", "Pros: speed, call quality, easy to use, photos, camera\n\nI have had the phone about a month now. It feels nice in my hands, I was worried because I have small hands but it has worked out well. Its very thin so a case is needed. I purchased the Otterbox Commuter and it is working well for me. The camera takes great photos, I rarely use my digital camera anymore. Call quality is very good. Android is easy to set up and use, I came from and iphone 3gs to Samsung Galaxy s2 then to the S4. Battery life is decent, better than the S2, I get through most of the day with moderate to heavy use. So many fun and useful apps, you won't regret buying this phone. Definitely recommend it.", "Pros: stores most of my info in one place\n\nCons: a little big\n\nPros - Easy to use, lots of apps, sleek design\nCons - small keyboard, phone is too big to text with one hand", "Pros: Fast and easy to set up\n\nCons: Short battery life\n\nSamsung did an awesome job with this phone!

BUT FOR THE REST OF THE PHONE IM IN LUV!!", "Pros: Very cool features, bright screen.\n\nCons: Takes time to connect to my car Bluetooth, my previous windos phone 7.5 was much faster than this one.\n\nThe display gorgeous, really vibrant, and I love the features so far. It's smooth, sleek, very thin. Mini SD card for extra storage!!! So convenient, you have lots of memory space on the palm of your hand.", "Pros: the different features\n\nCons: n/a\n\nAll of the new features, wave to answer, picture within a picture, i'm a bit jealous that I didn't also upgrade my phone from EVO 3D yet.\n\ni wish android would allow most of these apps to be deletable. they take up viable space that could be used for other things.", "Pros: The camera & talk & text feature\n\nCons: Of course as with any android - the battery life\n\nI have not even scratched the surface to what this phone will do since I am so pumped about the camera -mainly why I chose the S4. Pictures are a big part of my life because that's what you have left after all the fun & memories made. I love playing with all the features. For the most part it works well with my social media which is a big plus for me.", "Pros: Size of Screen Features and Thin!\n\nCons: The sound is not the best.\n\nI have just upgraded from the Samsung Fascinate and is awesome for the speed from 3G to 4G plus all the new features. The S4 has so many gadgets that I have not applied them all yet but on my way. The features are not fun but smart i.e. looking at the screen and it recognizing when I look away and shuts off, excellent!", "Pros: the things you can do with it\n\nCons: call quality sucks\n\nI love all the extra things the phone can do. If only the phone part was better. Then again I am using Sprint.", "Pros: Love the eye recognition feature\n\nCons: Nothing yet\n\nThis phone has been very helpful for me at my job. I am a technician at a Hyundai dealership and we are constantly getting people coming in with problems using their bluetooth or being able to listen to Pandora through their bluetooth. I was actually going to purchase the cheaper Galaxy S3 but my wife talked me in to getting the newer technology and I am glad she did. Its easy to use and the eye recognition feature is great! I love that if I am watching a video and take my eyes off the screen, the video pauses.", "Pros: Love the phone for all it's features,\n\nCons: Nothing yet.\n\nI bought the iPhone 5 and was not please. I changed it for this and it's so much better. It's easier to text. The camera is great.", "Pros: the big screen, easy to set up\n\nCons: battery life\n\nI had a iphone 4 previous to this phone and I prefer the Samsung - Galaxy S 4 4G because its way easier to use and has more features and a better camera.", "Pros: Will do almost anything you can think of\n\nCons: Will need to get used to charging my phone more often\n\nGreat smartphone...the display is awesome, lots of storage included, learning to use the functions is relatively easy with all of the online tutorials, and the app speed is great.", "Pros: good price\n\nCons: I havent found anything i dont like about the phone\n\nI love it, u can take soo many pictures in a couple of seconds and it has a nice big screen", "Pros: larger screen\n\nCons: Calls are not that great. Reception is not good\n\nOverall a good phone. The reception is not as good as my S2. I have the same network so it must be the phone. The phone requires a 16GB SD card or it will freeze/hang up when viewing pictures. I don't know why this happen, but since I upgraded the sd card it works find.", "Pros: Almost everything is perfect\n\nCons: Por Voice recognition for hands free driving\n\nI absolutely love this phone is fun to use just by looking at it is gorgeous. The motion sensory is so much fun I can't stop waving my hand over it. But unfortunately I drive a lot and I make a lot of phone calls so I need a decent to excellent voice recognition feature, this phone comes short when it comes to that. Plus my hand is small so operating it with one hand isn't that easy.", "Pros: camera is ridiculous\n\nCons: battery (but isn't that always the case)\n\nMy last iPhone was the 4s. I went swimming with it and needed a replacement till my contract was up. So I got the Google Nexus. That was my first experience with Android. Decent phone but not great. So when my contract came up for a new phone I had a dilemma:\n\nI'm an Apple fanboy and I'm typing this on an iMac. And the only smart phones I've ever owned are iPhones and that Nexus. I must admit the android OS is decent. On par with iOS but I wouldn't say better. Keep in mind both iOS and Android are getting new updates very soon so I would't put a lot of stake into the OS's at the moment.\n\nThat's not why I chose the Galaxy. I chose the Galaxy because it is a nicer phone and I heard that the iPhone \"6\" is gonna be a complete redesign. So I opted to wait and see. For now the Galaxy is awesome, no bones about it, I like my phone.\n\nBig pluses for me were the friggin awesome camera. No doubt in my mind this eliminates point and shoot cameras. They are no longer necessary as 13MP is great. I took a pic of a dragonfly from 12 inches away and can zoom in all the way to the veins in the wings and hair on the legs. CRAZY good camera. Plus the Galaxy has tons of bells and whistles that while not necessary are cool. To me some potential might be unlock able with Key Lime Pie and these already rich features. Plus the screen size is much more satisfying than the iPhone.\n\nNot saying I won't switch next year but I looked at the HTC One, Samsung Galaxy, and the iPhone 5, and specs for iPhone 5s. And this is the phone I walked out the door with.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Big Screen, Excellent Camera.\n\nCons: Haven't found anything\n\nHands down best phone I have ever had period. Camera whips an iPhone camera. Screen size is excellent. Easy to operate. Very happy!

There seems to be a delay in keypad response when texting. Haven't figured out what could be causing this. There are so many options that can be configured.

What sold me on this phone was 1) the ability to add a SD card. and 2)\nbeing able to replace the battery. I have a 64Gb Sd card in this and have 10000 songs on it, Yes you read it right 10 thousand songs!!! lol. Needless to say it replaced my old Zune which died anyway. Only thing i don't like about this phone is all the extra garbage you don't need on the phone. The Smart scroll stuff doesn't work well.In fact most of the smart stuff doesn't work well , you can search reviews about that all over the net, and the speaker is horrible!! and they put in on the back which is just dumb. When i need to put it on speakerphone i have to turn the phone around to hear it clearly. Obviously it was meant to be used with Bluetooth speakers or something. but this is a minor gripe or rather pet peeve of mine your milage will vary.

I highly recommend one of the growing number of e-books of tips and tricks for this phone.

Awesome phone everything is wonderful!!!", "Pros: Battery is better than the S3!\n\nCons: Nothing really I absolutely love it\n\nThe battery life is a lot better than the S3. The picture quality is wonderful! I love the new update and I am completely satisfied! I've had every phone there is. Best on market so far.", "Pros: 13 megapixel camera, awesome display, screen size\n\nCons: Nit a lot of accessories available yet\n\nAlways had iPhones and was concerned about switching to android - I'm glad I did!! If you're a techie this is the phone for you. Iphone 5 has nothing on the Galaxy S4 when it comes to all the things you can do with the phone everyday.

Otherwise, it is far better than any phone on the market.

The phone has not lagged on me at all and its works well multitasking. I highly recommend this galaxy s4.", "Pros: Customizable, Just right fit to hand, Fun.\n\nCons: Pre installed apps.\n\nI have had Motorola Blackberry, Motorola Droid X, Motorola Droid 4 for smart phones and this GS4 has to be my favorite so far.

Definitely my recommendation for a smart phone for anyone who asks.", "Pros: Has everything you need on the go\n\nCons: TouchWiz and the \"carrier bloat\"\n\nHaving owned the Galaxy S2 Skyrocket, the jump in specs and features has grown tenfold from that phone to the Galaxy S4. Detractors may say that a majority of the features the average person may never use, but that the phone can do all those things tells you how far smartphones have come and how a device can become a big part of your everyday life. The S4 essentially replaces my point-and-shoot camera, camcorder, PDA (yes, I've aged myself by owning one of these), GPS, organizer, calculator, checkbook, MP3 player, video player, office software and more, off the top of my head. I'm more an Android purist, so I'm sometimes at odds with TouchWiz, and the carrier apps (\"carrier bloat\") is taking up space, but overall, it's a great phone!\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Easily navigated\n\nCons: Shorter battery life\n\nI have had the phone for about a month now and don't have too many complaints other than the battery life but that is to be expected with smart phone like this. I would definitely recommend this phone to others.", "Pros: Everything really\n\nCons: Nothing so far\n\nI had an iPhone 4 since it was first released and over the past year thought about going to something else but could never make up my mind. I finally just felt like trying something new and so I went with the GS4 after a lot of research. So far I love the phone. Some people say it is too big especially when compared to the iPhone but I actually wonder how I had the iPhone so long after having this.

Great features, like the rear facing camera option, hand motion, microphone. I love having access to email, calendar, documents, etc without having to use my laptop so much. I just wish the battery life was longer and the vibration is too light. I have to charge it about everyday. Other than that, it's the perfect phone! No problems thus far.", "Pros: The size, the OS, and the screen are all great.\n\nCons: The syncing software is NOT good and there isn't a \"Find My Phone\" app even close to Apple's iPhone app.\n\nOverall the Galaxy S4 is Great so far.

I have an iPhone 5 and when comparing it with the GS4 overall I would take the GS4.", "Pros: Easy to use, good battery life\n\nCons: Expensive\n\nOverall this a great phone.

I love scrolling hands free. That should come in handy in the winter with gloves on. The camera is great and I use it to take tons of pictures of my baby. When I do the blast of 20 pictures in a row, he always starts smiling because of the sound so I'm sure to get a good picture. I also like that the phone learns the places I usually travel to and gives me traffic information before I leave. I also really like the bigger size screen.

Phone is light weight but I do recommend getting a good case for protection..", "Pros: The keyboard\n\nCons: camera does not allow many option to shoot.

There are so many neat things this phone does, but I haven't had time to learn them all yet. I also love the swipe to text.", "Pros: easy to use, great pictures and lots of extras\n\nCons: nothing so far.\n\nI was concerned that this phone would be too big but it is not.. I love the clear pictures , all the added features which im still finding.. As a middle age woman its nice to be able to see and use this phone without glasses.. Phone is light weight but I do recommend getting a good case for protection..", "Pros: The keyboard\n\nCons: camera does not allow many option to shoot. Many features that do not include step by step instructions.\n\nGreat phone for business, reading emails and searching for potential clients. I would of like a step by step tutorial on the phone to take advantage of the features I have heard about but can not figure out yet.", "Pros: Large Screen Gret Battery Smooth Operation\n\nCons: These Flagship Phones are still to expensive\n\nI have owned just about every generation of Cell Phone and every generation of SmartPhone. OG Droid, Droid Incredible, Thunderbolt, Incredible 4g, RAZR, Galaxy S3, and probably some in between, but this screen size is perfect for a personal data device and it is small enough to use as a phone. No complaints and I have owned this since it first arrived for Verizon.", "Pros: the customizable optikns are great, speach to text is aewsome. the voice message option is pretty cool and camera is gre\n\nCons: it takes some getting used to if you are an ok Iphone user bc its so customizable its overwhelming at first.\n\nGetting used to always going to the app screen was annoying at first since the Iphone had it so quick and ez but when you get passed that its a great phone, plenty of options like s beam to share photos and music. I really like the speach to text and it not having to be an app. I'm Happy with the phone.", "Pros: Ease of use, picture quality, battery life, and processor speed.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S4 is easy to use and comes loaded with apps. The battery life is more than I expected; I usually charge the battery ever other day.", "Pros: Great camera, navigation and lightweight\n\nCons: Sometimes the \"eye\" feature gets annoying because it doens't always like to stop or it moves too fast\n\nI feel like this phone is overall wonderful. It has great features, is easy to use, and is quick whether you're using wifi or regular internet. I would recommend it to anyone!", "Pros: Easy to use and take pictures and to search the internet .\n\nCons: Freexes sometimes .\n\nLove the phone and enjoy using it . The battery life is great also . Easy to use and good call quality .", "Pros: Its fun to use\n\nCons: nothing\n\nEvery day I learn something new about the Phone. It is full of features and works Awesome as a Phone. some people forget that.\nPlease keep making it.", "Pros: Screen and camera\n\nCons: nothing\n\nI have 6 phones on my account I was \"bullied\" into getting some iphone 5 I tried them and was unhappy needs to be on a charger 24/7 screen for babies (nice pictures but so so small) Hate having to \"i\"everything..this phone stays charged through my 100+ emails a day 75 texts per day and phone calls all day and night crisp clear calls like the goolge call feature like the free app's", "Pros: It is light-weight and has great color\n\nCons: Short battery and not easy to use\n\nI don't really like this phone at all. I thought I would love something new...larger screen and more light weight and great color, but the battery life goes quickly, no internet service unless I'm home or somewhere that has free WiFi, and lots of apps that you don't know anything about. I really miss my iPhone and wish I had just gotten a new one. Not a good experience for me.", "Pros: Configurable\n\nCons: Battery Life\n\nVery customizable which is great as I need some apps for my business. Processor is fast even in power saving mode. Would recommend to anyone that requires a smart phone.", "Pros: Phone is great. Price was good.\n\nCons: I wasn't shwon how to use this phone. Still have some issues that I don'tknow how to solve.\n\nThey are working on the SPRINT towers in my area and I cannot use my phone at home. That SUCKS!", "Pros: Ease of Use, Picture Quality, Sound Quality, Volume\n\nCons: Reception\n\nThis is a nice looking, easy to hold, easy to use device. I don't really call it a phone because it does so much more.\n\nI use the clock function to set alarms for myself, I use the camera to take quality pictures. It's easy to attach to my computer, either via USB or Bluetooth. There are loads of Apps to download for Android.\n\nI wish the call quality was better. There is always a lag when using cell phones, you know, talking over each other. That seems worse with this phone, to me. It may have to do with the signal via AT&T. I even obtained a microcell from AT&T to improve the signal at home, but I still have dropped calls occasionally. My wife has the identical phone in white and hers seems to have better reception than mine. It may have to do with the cases we are using. They are both Otterbox. Mine is the Defender which adds some bulk and hers is the Commuter which is much slimmer.\n\nOut and about, my device seems to work pretty well as a phone. It really excels at looking things up on the internet when we are out shopping or travelling around. We've only had them about a month and have much more to learn about them.\n\nIn summary, I would recommend these devices for anyone that wants to have the power of the internet and communications in the palm of their hand.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: large screen\n\nCons: voice mail is not visual like in iPhone\n\nIn comparison to the iPhone which I've had for long time, the S4 is not so easy to use, even for basic functions. Three screens to click on dial a call, versus one on iP, multiply by 100s of calls -- how tedious is that!", "Pros: Quad core speed and power,memory space,excellent screen\n\nCons: Some touted custom software features were disappointing\n\nImpressive speed and really blows away my previous phone which was an Evo Shift. Lots of room for apps. Screen really is impressive. Feels like I finally have a phone I can live with for 2 years.", "Pros: good screen, great camera\n\nCons: max ring volume too low\n\nMuch better camera than older models. SO MANY features I have not had the time to dig deep into them. Pleased user. Wish volume could be louder on phone rings.", "Pros: large screen, clear pictures, bright display\n\nCons: camara feature doesn't allow for editing\n\nOverall, I really like the S4. I have had an iPhone 4 for the last two years. I really liked the iPhone. I was hesitant to purchase the S4 because I have had a bad experience with an Android OS before. So far, I have had no major problems. It does take a little bit to get use to the new OS and the size of the phone. The keyboard is more spread out due to the size of the screen, so I am constantly misspelling words! I have had a hiccup with Outlook email for work. I can delete the email but days later will receive the same email again. I fixed the problem by not deleting the emails. I was disappointed to find you can't edit pictures with the software on the phone. I had to download an app to do so. However, I found a wonderful app to do so! I would recommend anyone get this phone.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Features\n\nCons: Not a pocket phone\n\nAmazing phone, but let me encourage you to either obsessively protect the device, or buy the insurance. I've known two people that broke their screens in the first week by carrying the phone in their pockets. For you aggressive phone users, buy a case, buy a screen protector, and BUY THE INSURANCE. Other than that, you won't be disappointed.", "Pros: Easy to set up and a lot of features\n\nThis is my daughter's phone, but she absolutely loves it! It takes great pictures and has ALL the features she likes and then some. I think this phone will keep her happy for the full length of time until it's time for an upgrade. Thank you Samsung and Best Buy for you Great service!", "Pros: features all day\n\nCons: somewhat fragile if dropped compared to other Samsung phones\n\nSo far I love this phone. When a company goes all out and packs a product full of new features and options, my first assumption is that most will not be useful or they will have bugs or that something is being sacrificed for the sake of extravagance. This is not the case here. Most if not all of the new features on the s4 are useful, not buggy, and nothing has been sacrificed here. The screen has beautiful color and resolution, phone is fast and responsive and all the neat bells and whistles are really useful. This is where the bar is set for the best phone on the market today.", "Pros: Configurable\n\nCons: Battery Life\n\nVery customizable which is great as I need some apps for my business. Processor is fast even in power saving mode. Would recommend to anyone that requires a smart phone.", "Pros: Organization of data\n\nCons: Las Vegas does not have good signals/tower set ups\n\nIt is nice.

Facial recognition for the lock as extra security is great too. I was an iPhone guy since the very first one and after the 4S I now upgraded to the galaxy S4 and don't seen self ever going back. iPhone can't touch this!", "Pros: Everything\n\nCons: battery but you can do things to make it better\n\nAwesome phone it took me a little bit to get use to it because I was an iPhone girl but not anymore!!!", "Pros: Great camera\n\nCons: swipe feature not as good as previous versions\n\nGreat over all phone. Great camera and amazing battery life. Unplugging the phone at 5 am and plugging it back in at 11pm while still having 50% battery life is amazing. A great upgrade.", "Pros: Flexible\n\nCons: Overall size, cheap feeling case\n\nI used this phone for 2 weeks, but went back to Iphone..this is just too awkward in size for me, and it doesn't integrate with my other Mac devices. I wanted to try it and see. For anyone used to Android, and wants a big phone, It would be great.", "Pros: One of the fastest phones at the time of this review.\n\nCons: Cant think of anything.\n\nGreat phone overall the screen size is perfect for me and the 1080p res is super crisp with vibrant colors.", "Pros: Lots of toys. Good battery life. Nice screen.\n\nCons: A little too thin. Feels flimsy compared to my HTC.\n\nVery cool features. Samsung advertises the stream but I think like the wifi direct feature much better. It allows you to send multiple files to anything with wifi direct without touching the devices together. The camera is amazing. I really like the panoramic mode. I'm happier with the phone than I expected.", "I absolutely LOVE this phone. Only reason why I knocked it to 4 starts was because the ameloid (spelling?) that is under the screen cracked today making it unusable (thank god for best buys protection coverage) It's been less then a month and it cracked while in my pocket, and seems to be a fairly common problem. So buy a protective cover.\n\nOther then that. It actually exceeded my expectations and is a truely amazing phone", "Pros: Organization of data\n\nCons: Las Vegas does not have good signals/tower set ups\n\nIt is nice. I am still working with it and am going to continue figuring this phones capabilities out.", "Pros: easy to text\n\nCons: battery life could be better\n\nbought this phone for my son, to uprade his htc samsung. much better product. love the bigger screen and much easier to text.", "Pros: love all the features\n\nCons: glass breaks easily\n\nI bought this phone as an upgrade for my semi responsible 14 Y.O. son he absolutely loves all the features and apps he has. I wish they would make a shock and water proof case for this phone though even though we have the insurance on it, It would put me a little more @ ease.", "Pros: battery life lasts all day\n\nCons: home button is close to screen, finger hits screen buttons\n\nGreat phone for the price, no complaints at the moment. I have had it for a month no problems with it.", "Pros: everything\n\nCons: nothing\n\nHonestly couldn't be any happier than I am with this phone it still amazes me how much it can do and its incredibly fast speed I'm still learning new things about it every single day and the camera 13mp completely astonishing it is completely mind blowing", "Pros: tons of features, overall best phone for multi purposes\n\nCons: nothing really\n\nThe phone does it all extremely well.extra features such as face down silent mode and motion gestures are very useful. The video and pictures taken are also the best I've seen taken on any smartphone and there are a bunch of extra video and picture effects to work with.\nIPod equivalent audio quality\nIR remote control for any room\nSuper sensitive touch for use for Winter days wearing ANY type of gloves.\nIPHONE killer :)", "Pros: screen resolution and processing speed\n\nCons: without a case the phone is extremely slippery\n\nI would Definitely recommend this phone it is currently at the top of tech and has alot of nice extra features like the build in ir blast(tv remote)", "Pros: Easy to use\n\nI previously had a Iphone 4 and was not happy. I am pleased with the Samsung Galaxy S4. It is very easy to use and it also takes great pictures.", "Pros: Its has evrything i need and more.\n\nCons: Doesnt have gorilla glass.\n\nThe phone is great. I watch a lot of videos so the hd is awesome and the extra features are so cool.", "Pros: Picture quality,size,overall feel and quality.\n\nCons: none\n\nThe samsung s4 is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a phone that not only looks good it also works great", "Pros: picture quality\n\nCons: easily set off while putting in pocket\n\nthis phone works very well...picture quality is excellent...easily set off though when putting in pocket though", "Pros: I love the interface, the scrolling pages with your eyes and waving of your hand.\n\nI love this phone. This is the best phone out. I love the camera, the functionality of the phone. Wouldn't trade this phone for anything.", "Pros: phone is great, fast and excellent screen color\n\nCons: none\n\nthe is very good and fast. I like being able to add short cuts to lock screen. The colors on the screen are bright and easy to see! Love the screen size and the new features over the S2. Will continue to buy samsung!", "Pros: For a thinner phone, the battery life is awesome; everything I need in one cell pone.\n\nCons: I haven't found anything that I didn't like.\n\nI wanted a bigger screen phone that takes picture perfect pictures and this phone certainly does all that and much more. I love how I can print directed to my printer from my cell. When I print out pictures taken with my cell, they are awesome, crystal clear! All I can say is \"Get It, You Will Love It.\"", "Pros: Picture qualit and internet speed\n\nCons: Hand wave motion only works on certain apps only\n\nAll in all its a good phone and I got a $50 gift card too which reduced the price.", "Pros: Screen, processor\n\nCons: features that I don't use, documented lag\n\nThis is my favorite phone, but remember no phone is perfect. I've owned more than I'd like to admit, but in the end, it's good to know what you need so you can make a good choice. Is this a good phone for you?\n\nWell for me, I love the customizable Android interface. Since I liked the Windows Phone Metro tiles, I installed Launcher 8. With the large Android App market, it was a great combo.\n\nI love the 1080p screen. I'm sad I don't have dual front-firing stereo speakers, but I can live without that. The camera helps a ton when you don't have your DSLR. But it's still just a camera phone, even though one of the best ones.\n\nI don't really need all the fancy extras Samsung put on this phone. So I shut off most of them, easily enough. I do like sending out movies directly from my phone to my Samsung TV though, so thanks Samsung!\n\nYet the biggest weakness perhaps is the lag. For one of the fastest phone processors in the market, it does stutter with basic scrolling of web pages. Yes, believe it or not, it's a fact, look on YouTube if you need, or visit the forums. But instead of griping, I found a solution: get a replacement. After 2 exchanges, BestBuy's service policy allowed me to find a good refurbished one without as much lag. Perhaps it's a quality control issue with Samsung, with all the extra crazy features. All I know is BestBuy has my back.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Excellent price & ringtone volume.\n\nI have had my Galaxy s4 for about a month now. I love the camera and picture quality.

Awesome features like smart pause and run two apps at one time with both of them on the screen.", "Pros: Its has evrything i need and more.\n\nCons: Doesnt have gorilla glass.\n\nThe phone is great.

Primarily use it for movies and internet. It is fast. Handles streaming video without much waiting. Great memory.", "Pros: big, bright high res screen\n\nCons: phone doesn't sleep, it goes into a coma\n\nI upgraded from the S2, so this phone isn't a whole lot different from that one.\nIt can multitask, which I played around with but haven't figured out why I would need it yet.\nIn general, I'm just as happy with this phone as I was with the S2 (which I loved). The only problem is that, apparently, one of the apps I installed (and I didn't install that many) causes the phone to not wake up after I set it down for a while. To use my phone requires me to force it to shut down then power on again. A visit to the Sprint store told me what I already knew; an app is causing the problem, don't know which one, reset the phone to factory default, and setup all my stuff again. A time consuming PIA!", "Pros: Easy to set up, good price for the features\n\nCons: The sound quality of the ringtone/calls could be better\n\nOverall, I love this phone. The ringtone/call volume could be better but for the price and the features offered the phone is great. The manual that came with the phone could be a bit more detailed but I guess there is no need I guess when you can download the entire manual (it's just a shame that you would have to do that to figure out how to use the new features).", "Pros: Everything\n\nCons: Nothing\n\nGot this phone for my wife and she absolutely loves it. Great camera, easy functions. Excellent phone overall! Highly recommend it!", "Pros: the camera is awesome and it's a light phone\n\nCons: battery could last a tittle longer, dies quickly while using gps\n\nI really like my galaxy s4it is light and the camera is awesome takes really good pictures!I also love how big the screen is easy to see everything. Something that I don't like is the automatic updates when I turn the phone off and back on it reset the automatic updates. I like to know when things are updating I don't want it to update by itself. The navigation system updated and I uninstalled the update because I liked it the way it was before the update and when I turned the phone off and back on it went ahead and updated again anyway.", "Pros: Samsung packs all the latest features into the Galaxy S4\n\nCons: Included storage space and useless novel features like eye tracking\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S4 is a great upgrade from my previous S2.

It is slim, easy to use, great for picture taking, and light in weight.", "Pros: Everything\n\nCons: Nothing\n\nHonestly, all this phone needs is a biometric sensor suite and I'll be transported to the bridge of the Enterprise.

I have been a blackberry and android user for years and was about to switch to an iPhone b/c my wife's iPhone 5 is so cool! So glad I didn't make the switch!

The Samsung Experience was a great help and the gentleman working there was a great help and was able to explain all features and benefits. It was explained that by using Samsung's service Smart Switch, I could keep all my contacts, photos, songs, texts (SMS), notes, alarms, bookmarks, etc. from my old phone...even though it was an iPhone. A list of the apps I had on m iPhone was also generated, so I was able to download all the same great apps I had too.\n\nThe phone is much larger than I'm used to, and the AMOLED screen is large and bright. It has the latest in gorilla glass from what I was told, so it should be pretty strong. The customization is great, but may not be as user friendly at first if you are used to iOS. First impression was that typing was a bit clunky. Luckily, the Google Play store have plenty of downloadable keyboard options you can purchase. The ability to upgrade memory was a HUGE deal to me. With the phone being 16 gigs, you can get another 32 gigs with an SD card for less than $50.\n\nYou can extend the battery life by not keeping certain features on all the time like: GPS, Bluetooth, WiFi, Mobile data, NFC, Sync, and some of the gimmicky features. There are plenty of videos on YouTube to help in this regard.\n\nI've had the phone for nearly a week, and I do not regret converting, even though all my best friends have iPhones.

I LOVE IT!! No problems at all with the phone. It is super fast, easy to use, large screen and slim. The camera features are amazing. I love that you can say cheese and it will take the picture. There are alot of different camera modes to use...all wonderful. I have received positive comments on my photos saying...they look as if they were taken with a nice SLR camera. I don't personally like to use smart scroll, air view or smart pause because I think it is too touchy...it's better than not recognizing at all but it's too much for me so I turned those features off.

Although that wasn't a great phone I still liked where Google was going with their Android platform. I stuck with HTC, eventually going through several versions of the Evo (3D, LTE, etc...) My wife has the Samsung Galaxy S3 and wanted to upgrade to the S4. We went to Best Buy for the upgrade and found out she wasn't yet eligible but I was....with all the incentives we ended up making about $50 (meaning we spent no money for the upgrade), so I figured why not? The Samsung S4 is THE most advanced phone out there, hands down.

Convenient to have one item that can take pictures, call, text, organize my calendar, etc.", "Pros: Easy to use, fast, light\n\nCons: Android is not as simple as Apple iOS\n\nGalaxy S4 is a great mobile device. I added 64GB of storage for all of my music and pics. for less that $25. Great call quality. Beautiful big screen. Performance is overall faster than iP5, hands down. I still enjoy my iPhone, but the S4 is now my first choice.", "Pros: great screen, great battery life, excellent camera, and lots of features\n\nCons: Phone has a slight lag\n\nDid my research and the S4 had everything I needed in a phone.

The sound quality at high volume was a struggle to come up with something that actually annoyed me. I was a former HTC owner, and BlackBerry before that, but when it came time to upgrade, my friends couldn't say enough good things about the Galaxy series. Since the S4 was fairly reasonable in price, decided to go with thenewest model rather than the S3. I love everything about this phone - the image quality for video and pictures was the first thing that impressed me. I still have not trained it to obey correctly with The air gesture modes, but I am in love with the swipe texting. The Swype texting allows predictive text to learn from your email accounts, among other things, to know what words you use often and to improve the guesswork when you swipe your finger across the qwerty touchscreen, only lifting your finger between words. It takes some time for the phone to learn, but since I text and chat a lot, it's been incredibly helpful.

Camera, etc...\n\nCons: Too large, hard to use with one hand and not as easy to navigate as iphone\n\nI liked many features of this phone but was just too hard to use because of the size.

I am getting used to the feel of this phone. I have used Motorola (Droid & Droid Bionic) in the past and this is my first Samsung, so the interface is a little different and the weight is less, but it functions smoothly. I would recommend this phone. As Android evolves, this seems to be a good option for being able to handle the increased demands of memory.", "Pros: Good battery life, quick processor, accurate speech to text capabilities\n\nCons: Eye scroll doesn't work very well\n\nLove this phone. Best battery I have ever had. Better than my S2 and I don't turn anything off. I am careful to not plug it in every waking chance or use it unless I have to while it is charging though. Camera is great, screen is awesome, and something the iPhone needs to get is swipe. The not so good part is the newest feature, the auto scroll with your eyes. I have yet to get it to work, but then again that's not that big of a deal to me. Also, the screen is not as durable as my S2. Thinner has its downfall in that regards.", "Pros: easy to use. camera.\n\nCons: haven't found this out yet.\n\nI love this phone.

I had a choice to pick either the HTC One, iPhone 5, or the GS4. I loved the way my GS3 looked and felt and kind of wanted the same thing. So after trying all of my choices I knew the S4 was for me. I do admit it was a tough choice between the HTC One and GS4 but when it came to my final decision the GS4 won my heart. It had more features than the HTC One and iPhone Put Together not to mention the bigger 5 inch screen! It had a better video quality, better camera, better performance, better features (Air Gestures are amazing!), and better customization. I've had my GS4 for 3 months now and I have never had any problems with it. It does exactly what i need it for (which is everything) and I keep on learning new things everyday!\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: easy to use, intuitive set up, high quality, great sound\n\nCons: nothing\n\nThis is my first smart phone, and it is the best! It is easy to set up, personalize, and really fun to use.", "Pros: I had done a lot of research prior to this purchase. I really like the Watch On app, the camera phenomenal!\n\nCons: Speaker, battery life not as great as advertised\n\nI love this phone! I had done quite a bit of research prior to my purchase. The Samsung apps are great, especially the fitness tracker, Watch On, and photo apps. I'm still learning how to use a lot of the features; but so far so good. There are only 2 things I'm not so crazy about. The battery life is not as great as advertised (although I'm a heavy user admittedly), and I wish Samsung had incorporated a front facing speaker for playback as the volume isn't very loud when using speaker phone or watching video. Other than that, I'm very happy with my purchase and highly recommend the Samsung S4.", "Pros: Camera , speed is super fast\n\nCons: the service where i live, no 4g service\n\nThe camera works great. the only downfall of the s4 would the absolute no 3g service at all. when im in an area with no 4g my phone does not work at all. this is very frustrating.", "I got rid of my iphone 4 for this phone. My iphone got a lot better service than this one and I constantly do not have service where I usually would have. Other than that, camera, features, everything else is great!", "Pros: Fast/Powerful\n\nCons: Battery life\n\nAlthough, this is a very powerful/sleek phone and is great value for the price, there are a couple of things that can be a bit bothersome:\n1)The screen is just a little too big (wide) to maneuver using just one hand, i.e. holding and texting w/the same hand (in case the other hand is occupied).\n2)Poor pic quality in low light.\n3)Screen can appear to be dull at times.\n4)Although, the phone has tones of cool features (i.e. air gestures/motion tracking, etc.), they appear to consume a lot of battery, so i find myself having to turn them off most of the times.", "Pros: Easy to use. Camera is excellant.\n\nCons: Battery life is short. Have to be sure to charge it all the time\n\nI love the phone even though the battery life is short. I spend a lot of time charging the phone, even though I am not using many apps. Screen is more durable then the iphone which I had to replace multiple times because of breakage.

The screen size is just amazing. I would recommend this smartphone over the iphone 5 anyday.", "Pros: It does everything\n\nCons: Still sometimes laggy. For a high end phone like this, it shouldn't be.\n\nI upgraded from my Galaxy S3 with a little hesitation. It looked the same, but had a slightly bigger screen. Instantly I was glad I chose to upgrade. Along with the higher resolution, some of the software, including the keyboard, were much improved.\n\nI tried out the IR blaster and some of the air gesture features. Although I don't use them on a regular basis, I have actually had the need for the IR blaster when a 5 year old who was visiting decided it would be fun to hide our remote controls.\n\nAnyway, I am happy with the phone and would recommend it over the S3 if purchasing a new contract. If you're on a budget, the S3 is still not a bad choice.", "Pros: Love the screen size\n\nCons: Group texting not as good as the IPhone\n\nI just switched from IPhone to Andriod. Overall I love the phone and will not go back. Two things I do not like are: The video quality is so good the videos cannot be sent by text messages. You have to record in a lower quality to send. The other is the group text. It took awhile to get it to work and now my group text come back on an individual thread that has to be downloaded. After download it send to the group text. So I get two notifications for one simple \"LOL\" text. Kind of annoying. Other than that I love the phone. The camera is AWESOME.", "Pros: Most everything\n\nCons: May be large for some\n\nI had set out for a smaller phone than my htc thunderbolt but was left with only 2 options...an iPhone, which I did not want as I prefer the android platform and didn't want to buy all new accessories, and one other older android. I didn't really care for that so checked out the new Samsung galaxy 4 and heard really great things about it. Yes it's bigger than I wanted but other than that I am very pleased with it. Great screen resolution, easy to navigate, no issues so far that I can think of except my sd card was loose or something so keeping an eye on that.

My favorite things about it are:\n- By far the camera on this phone is awesome. If used in good lighting you can get some great pictures, primarily close-ups with a lot of depth of field. (See flower image)\n- It is highly customizable if you take the time to do it.\n- The settings are easy to access to adjust the additional features, brightness, wifi, etc.\n- The widgets on Android are pretty cool after coming from iphone.", "Pros: motions and gestures\n\nCons: nothing\n\nBest phone I've ever bought.

I like the larger screen, yet it fits in my hand just right.", "Pros: It's a laptop, camera, radio, and phone -in-one in a smaller item to carry around.\n\nIt was easy to use the camera and almost have the same megapixel like my digital camera. Didn't need to use my other camera during my recent month vacation. It was easy to access my emails when internet was available where I went.

In my house we have been dedicated Apple users for several years and have built up a fairly large library from iTunes so it was a difficult choice. I did some research and found out by using a program called DoubleTwist you could use almost all the music from your iTunes library (anything you have purchased without DRM for $1.29). My son loves the phone and especially enjoys the extra screen real estate when not using it as phone. It is loaded with many cool new features which seems to have surpassed the iPhone for now. I like the fact that Samsung allows access to battery & Sim card if you ever need that.\n\nThe potential downsides are that Android supposedly has a greater chance for viruses and it is not as seamless and experience as Apple/Mac/iTunes.

I love how quickly the iphone 5 takes photos, especially since I have a 3-year-old. Although this camera is not quite that fast, it is considerably faster than the Droid 3 and does a decent job at taking fast photos and the editing software it comes with is a lot of fun. Screen size is just right, not too big but is great if you enjoy viewing and editing photos and doing most of your browsing/facebook-checking on your phone. Call quality is great, overall easy to navigate---oh, and the video is not too shabby, either.

But with the Galaxy S4 it's not so bad because it's such a powerful phone. The UI is a lot better than it was with my original Galaxy S phone a few years ago.\nThey've done a great job with a lot of extra features. Some of them are pretty quirky and not that great, but some of them work very well. My favorite is the Air View. This one gives you previews of messages, emails and menus in the default browser just by holding your finger close enough to the screen without touching it. The downside to this feature? It makes the screen WAY too sensitive so it unlocks and changes everything while it's in my pocket.\nDown side is it's all plastic. The back piece doesn't scratch quite as often as I thought it would, so that's nice, neither does the screen. There is a line of metal around the phone where the power/volume buttons and the USB charger are, but just between that and the screen is plastic that is chrome covered. When that chrome gets a small dent or scratch it starts to chip... And I hate cases unfortunately for my phone so one small drop is causing all that instead of your typical small ding.\nOverall, a fantastic phone.

The size is also a bit of a drawback, but is very light which out weighs the negative.", "Pros: Super fast processor.\n\nCons: Easy to use a lot of data. With phone working so fast.\n\nThis thing is awesome. Battery last a day while playing music. The new android platform is much better than the one that was on my previous galaxy s2. Very happy with the phone.", "Pros: Fast Processor\n\nCons: Limited Storage\n\nI recently upgraded from a HTC Thunderbolt to a Samsung Galaxy S4. I forgot how fast a phone could. Switching between apps is seemless. The touchwiz overly is ok. It takes some time to get used to. The air technology is nice, however I do not use it often. Only downfall is removing the bloatware from the device. That may be a Verizon issue in general.", "Pros: lighter bigger screen without making the phone larger than the s3\n\ngreat phone, great pictures, great screen, fast big display, just all around a piece o great tech!", "Pros: size and user friendly\n\nCons: have to charge the battery daily\n\nI am glad i took a step up in technology with this phone well worth the price anf the features are awesome", "Pros: screen resolution and features\n\nCons: battery life still lacks, over priced\n\nUpgraded from the original Galaxy and don't see much of a difference in 3 iterations of the phone.\n\nStill not pleased with how Samsung imports contacts.

I never thought that I would see the day - but when I qualified for a rebate, I debated waiting for the 5S or getting the S IV now. With having an iPad, I thought that I would be irritated that my devices didn't sync together, etc. That is not the case. I like the freedom of having my phone \"different\" than my tablet, and having the personalized customization options. There are a LOT of features on this phone, some that I will probably never used, but so far it has worked well.

Excellent camera. Phone is easy to use.", "Pros: durable, fast, good battery, sleek\n\nCons: stereo front facing speakers would be nice\n\nThe first week I dropped the phone waist high on pavement and it didn't damage at all. I love the expandable MicroSD card slot which no Apple products have. I initially thought it would be too large but it's so thin and the screen is most of the phone that's it's about the size length and width as my previous Bionic. It's super fast, great battery life. The iPhone looks so old compared to the interface of the Android. I love the multitasking and dual screen features as well as the gestures.", "Pros: Everything\n\nCons: Nothing\n\nGreat phone, love it!

I also like how Samsung is syncing all the products together like tv, cameras, tabs, phones, computers, hopefully they keep going like fridge/stove. that would be nice!!!", "Pros: Screen, camera, Amdroid Jellybean.\n\nCons: Hand gestures and gimmicks.\n\nAmazing phone, I am completely happy with it.

All my electronics are quickly becoming Samsung, their quality is outstanding. The S4 is very fast, apps load quickly and smoothly but the virbrant crystal clear screen is so fresh.

I use it as a phone and as a computer, although my typing skills are not as good with a phone.", "Pros: features\n\nCons: As with all smart phone, battery life could always be longer. I get about 2 days with regular use.\n\nWas not sure initially if I was going to get this phone due to the large size (I like smaller phones which fit easily in pocket). Now I like the size as it is prefect for the internet, viewing pictures and watching movies without being excessively large so you cannot fit it easily in your pants. The thin size helps to make it not bulky from that standpoint as well.", "Pros: Everything. No, really, EVERY THING\n\nCons: Apps are expensive\n\nThe best phone on the market, hands down. I will never go back to the iphone. I'm just upset with myself I didn't switch earlier.", "Pros: love air gestures\n\nCons: haven't come across anything yet\n\nI love this phone.

It is a fantastic phone that gives the iPhone a run for its money. I would say that the S4 is probably the best Android phone currently on the market judging from reviews and experience. No-one would be disappointed with this phone.", "After playing with both the HTC-1 and the S4, the S4 won out. Beyond the nice sized HD screen, I like the fact that I can replace the battery, the SD card capability (I don't need a second device to hold all my music with a 32gig Micro SD card), 4G LTE speeds are amazing vs WiMax.\n\nAll in all a vast step up from the EVO 4G (WiMax) phone I had", "Pros: The picture quality is awesome\n\nCons: Battery life isnt as great as my previous phone\n\nOverall I love this phone!

I like it better than my old iphone!!", "Pros: Does just about everything\n\nCons: It's a bit large\n\nScreen is clear and processor is fast. However, I find the screen size a bit large for one-hand operation. Using the pull-down window requires me to hold the phone in a less stable position that makes it more probable to drop if not using 2 hands.", "Pros: Very Fast\n\nCons: Battery Life and Touch Screen Issues\n\nLove this phone. It is very fast and has a lot of great features. I wish the battery life was better and am not so happy with the touch screen locking up at random times.", "Traded in my iPhone to give android a try. There are some things I miss from apple but this phone is amazing on its own. The 13 MP camera does an outstanding job with pictures. The screen size is one of the primary reasons I switched from Apple and it does NOT disappoint. I will see if Apple can catch up to Android with features before switching back, but for now I am happy with my decision", "Pros: Ease of use, great call clarity\n\nCons: Can't see the screen in the outdoors\n\nExcellent phone all in all. Love the battery life - where I had to charge my Bionic 2 times a day with heavy use, this S4 is normally still at 50% by the end of a busy day. Does lots of advanced things that I haven't learned yet but I'm working on it. The basics were very easy to pick up on. Very happy with this phone overall.", "Pros: fast processor, quality camera, multi-tasking\n\nCons: battery\n\nSpent time with Iphone and HTC One before going with Galaxy. I'm typical phone is my life user. Processing speed stands out compared to rest but noticed after having phone one month that battery life will be an issue as with most phones.", "Pros: The camera takes beautiful pictures. It's fast and has a lot of phone memory so one can download a lot of apps.\n\nCons: It's so sensative to the touch that sometimes it does something that I didn't mean for it to do.\n\nThis is really a fun gadget and very useful. It does so much that I'm sure I'll not be able to learn it all. I am having problems with the air gesture feature; it doesn't always work. I haven't figured out why and the voice control also seems to be hit and miss. But seeing that I'm still learning how to use it, I'm not going to say that those features are faulty yet. I was very surprised on how long the battery lasts compared to my last phone. I can listen to I Heart Radio all day and not drain it even half way.", "Pros: Intuitive features.

But the reception awful bearly can us any of the features. Phones always roaming. Its happens on all the galaxy's I've u had. this ones no better. Battery life is awesome.", "Pros: all the bells and whistles of the note 2 and then some but without the bulkiness\n\nGlad I got it. Love the upgraded features. Perfect for all of my everyday needs. Upgraded from the motorola photon and wish it had a kickstand.", "Pros: simple to use\n\nCons: battery\n\ngreat phone,much better that the I-phone than I used to have,for the price I got a lot and I won't mind to spread the message about this phone", "Pros: More features than u will ever use\n\nCons: Not very durable\n\nPhone is awesome. Learn something new everyday. Not a phone geek so I don't use all the extra features that is has. They are neat though.", "Pros: Everything So far\n\nCons: Volume button seems to not stay where i left it..Goes to silent\n\nI am very happy with this Phone (only had a couple of months) the only issue I haven't figured out yet is when I leave it in my pocket set to vibrate \"ONLY\" it seems to get changed through out the day to \"SILENT\" and I've missed some calls", "Pros: Easy to use, fully customizable\n\nCons: battery life\n\nits a great phone, super light, and the screen is absolutely flawless. battery still needs work, like most Droid phones, but it is far better from past models. the high megapixel camera is awesome, along with the high def video. the music player is a little sketchy, but not to bad. sound quality in calls could be a tad better, but still very clear over past models. overall, great phone.", "Pros: nothing yet\n\nCons: price for function\n\nThe phone is fragile. Even with the screen protector and cover the screen quit working. I didn't drop it or remember bumping against anything but am now having to pay for a new screen. I didn't get the protection plan but am now into it over $700 including accessories and don't get it back until next week.(after only having it 5 weeks) It isn't a bad phone, I shouldn't have been so stupid to think that everything they advertised would be debugged. Glad I bought at this store as at least I had a human to get my old phone working. What a waste of money.", "Pros: THE CAMERA IS INSANE , NOT TO MENTION BATTERY LIFE!\n\nCons: THE SPEAKER IS NOT TO LOUD\n\nI UPGRADED FROM AN S3 AND I WOULD HAVE TO SAY I AM VERY PLEASED. IF I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE QUALITY OF THE S3, THE S4 IS A BEAST!", "Pros: Easy to navigate thru the phone\n\nCons: Will break easily so will recommend a strong case cover\n\nThis phone is great, the camera and the sound on this phone are awesome. I love this phone.", "Pros: Size, battery, equipment\n\nI've had many Droids and this galaxy S4 is the best one or right now, My last phone was RAZR Maxx I loved that phone because of the battery life the galaxy S4 is very close in battery usage plus the galaxy has many other useful features.", "Pros: Screen size, picture quality, features, customization\n\nI have owned a Galaxy S2, S3, and now the S4. It is a fantastic phone that gives the iPhone a run for its money. I would say that the S4 is probably the best Android phone currently on the market judging from reviews and experience. No-one would be disappointed with this phone.", "Pros: User friendly\n\nCons: battery life\n\nGreat features very user friendly, but some of the most handy features / apps drain the battery so much that I had to turn them off to get a full days work done on a full battery charge.", "Pros: love air gestures\n\nCons: haven't come across anything yet\n\nI love this phone. I could not make up my mind between the Iphone 5 and the Galaxy S4. I'm glad I made the right decision to buy the S4.", "Pros: the camera and picture quality are excellent!!\n\nCons: phone is a little big to operate with one hand.\n\nAll in all its a great phone! I like it better than my old iphone!!", "Pros: More features than u will ever use\n\nCons: Not very durable\n\nPhone is awesome. Learn something new everyday. Not a phone geek so I don't use all the extra features that is has. They are neat though.", "Pros: features\n\nCons: As with all smart phone, battery life could always be longer. I get about 2 days with regular use.\n\nWas not sure initially if I was going to get this phone due to the large size (I like smaller phones which fit easily in pocket). Now I like the size as it is prefect for the internet, viewing pictures and watching movies without being excessively large so you cannot fit it easily in your pants. The thin size helps to make it not bulky from that standpoint as well.", "Pros: Ease of use, great call clarity\n\nCons: Can't see the screen in the outdoors\n\nExcellent phone all in all. Love the battery life - where I had to charge my Bionic 2 times a day with heavy use, this S4 is normally still at 50% by the end of a busy day. Does lots of advanced things that I haven't learned yet but I'm working on it. The basics were very easy to pick up on. Very happy with this phone overall.", "Pros: a lot of features\n\nCons: music player sometimes has a mind of its own\n\nOverall, I think this phone is pretty awesome. It has a lot of really great features that are easy to use. There is still a lot that i have to learn.", "Pros: Everything\n\nCons: The sound\n\nI think it's one of the best phones our there! The camera is awesome the screen is amazing. 5 inches may be big but to me it fits perfectly. Love how its not heavy or bulky like most phones. The air gestures work real good, I love it! Everything on this phone is all up to date and is perfect for me! The battery lasts me all day. Normally I'm texting all day or on the phone. It's only charging when I'm home or playing games most of the times. This phone is my life. You can do so much with it. I highly recommend this because it beats the iPhone by a lot! Although I would like to get the same apps as apple but I prefer Google play over anything. I love my s4.", "Pros: Everything So far\n\nCons: Volume button seems to not stay where i left it..Goes to silent\n\nI am very happy with this Phone (only had a couple of months) the only issue I haven't figured out yet is when I leave it in my pocket set to vibrate \"ONLY\" it seems to get changed through out the day to \"SILENT\" and I've missed some calls", "Pros: Form Factor, Software,\n\nCons: Screen Size, Internal Memory\n\nSo we always upgrade our phones together, and I am the IT support for it. So I want the phones to be cutting edge for me, but not over-the-top for her. I'd say the S4 does just that.\n\nI like the tech specs and some of the bells and whistles Samsung incorporated. Some of them are just cheap parlor tricks (eyes away from the screen, scrolling) and some of them are pretty useful.\n\nI was reluctant to upgrade for the last fe years because of the screen size wars. I want the phone in my pocket, and hers needs to fit into her purse. This just barely does both.\n\nJellybean is a solid OS. It is actually quite intuitive, and seems to be stable as can be. VERY pleased with that.\n\nCamera is outstanding on this phone. I have my DSLR, but I almost wonder if we've reached the point where we don't need P&S camera's anymore.\n\nShe is happy with the phone and so am I. There's very few times where I have to take it over and fix something for her. Very happy with the purchase.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Lot more gadgets and picture quality\n\nCons: Phone quality\n\nWould not recommend over I phone. This has great camera and picture quality but phone itself is not good. I have many drop calls and voice quality is extremely poor.", "Pros: Large screen and great quality\n\nCons: Takes some getting used to\n\nIt came down to the HTC One and the Samsung Galaxy S4 and I'm glad I went with the S4. My previous phone was an HTC Inspire and I initially thought the screen on it was going to be too large, but I got used to it. The same with the Galaxy. I look at my inspire now and it looks tiny compared to the Galaxy, but I'm used to the S4 now too.\nBattery lasts a whole day, even with data turned on most of the time.", "Pros: The picture, sound, battery life, storage.\n\nCons: I really haven't found anything that I don't like!\n\nLove the bigger screen, the 4G and everything about this phone. I would recommend this phone for the beginner as well as the novice smart phone user!", "Pros: Camera is easy to use. Plenty of functionality\n\nCons: Nothing yet\n\nI have been waiting fora new phone for a long time and this answered everything I needed.", "Pros: Large screen, excellent colors, decent built quality, camera in daytime, few good gesture features.\n\nCons: laggy during use when switching between apps or digging around, outside view difficult,camera focus bad in door of dark.\n\nI had this phone for 14 days and i would say its an excellent phone with alot of great features. call quality is clear, sounds is good enough, screen is very clear and contrast on the screen is excellent. the camera takes an excellent picture in the bright daytime. Some of the features is a little sloppy to work. The system can be laggy once in a while, i didnt like the way the phone seem laggy when my old iphone 4s never did. taking a indoor shot can be very difficult because it takes blurry shots. you would have to focus it first and take your time to get a good shot. the phone built quality is pretty good. Samsung needs to get an update for this phone to fix some of the problems (laggy interface and transition, camera focus, low light shots). I did love the phone but Iphone beats it on software interface which is what makes a phone works wonderful.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: easy to use and usually last all day\n\nCons: battery life was great for the first month. I've noticed it is slowly not lasting as long.\n\nI would recommend this phone to everyone. Easy to use and takes excellent pictures.", "I tried this from an iphone. Once you've learned how to use it, its okay, but I've still found that oftentimes it will just stick where it is and freeze. Some things seems a bit slower, or apps just aren't as smooth as I\"m used to. It's also annoying that I can't use regular autocorrect and I have to manually hit the words when my typing doesn't mesh. I've also found that I have more trouble getting the keys to recognize what I've actually typed. Maybe my fingers are too big, but I didn't have this issue before.", "Pros: awesome camera along with a whole bunch of other features\n\nCons: Bluetooth could have been clearer\n\nOverall, its a great device. Still learning how to maximize the use of each feature.", "Pros: Camera, Display\n\nCons: Getting used to new features\n\nI've been a motorola cell phone user for years, and this is my first Samsung device.. and it's a tough getting used to. I know I'm probably not using half of the phone's full features.\nOverall though, it's a super quick phone with a nice big screen, and an awesome camera!", "Pros: intuitive, user friendly,\n\nCons: not the simplest learning curve\n\nGreat phone, great features. Probably the most advanced phone to date. I loved my iPhone and Apple may win my business next time but in 2013 the S4 is where it's at!", "Pros: everything!!! great screen. split screen. fast internet.\n\nCons: nothing\n\nI traded my iPhone 4s for this phone and I am very satisfied. My initial reservation was the internal memory. However, there is an expandable memory capability that will allow you to add more memory. Bought a micro sd card and now I'm off and running. This phone is awesome!!!", "Pros: 1st phone my wife has never complained about. If you only knew how incredible of a feat this is.\n\nFast and great battery life. Good balance of overall size and screen size.", "Pros: Excellent camara\n\nCons: Feels Plasticy\n\nVery fast operating system. Veryvery please with the Quality of the camara.....\nEvery day I learn a NEW thing the phone is able to do.", "Pros: latest technology, easy to use\n\nCons: large phone\n\nWell, I got one for my son and one for my daughter. The size of the phone is much more noticeable when she holds her phone. I actually told her to be careful with it. Otherwise, the camera is excellent and we have no complaints about the phone. The operating system, I think, is pretty easy to learn. I'm glad I bought each of my kids one.", "Pros: Simplicity in setting up apps\n\nCons: Turning on with protector case difficult\n\nI had the Droid Razor and absolutely hated it. Turned it in early and went back to Samsung and I've been happy ever since!", "Pros: I love that the apps continue to update without me having to do anything and the camera is awesome\n\nCons: Nothing\n\nAs an Iphone 4 user I was somewhat hesitant. But after checking out all of the details of this phone I was impressed and will continue to stay with Samsung. You can do so much with this phone", "Pros: Camera is great\n\nCons: Took away useful functions and added things I don't need\n\nPro: long battery life, great camera, fast.\nCon: Took away functions I used (like the \"Recent\" option when texting someone you recently texted; also can't send a photo from the text window.). Added dumb, complicated functions (like the postage stamp window on the camera where you can add yourself to a group photo. DUMB.) Very cheapo case, doesn't feel like a quality product. Also did not come with an SD card, had to buy it separately. DUMB.", "Pros: All the cool stuff u can do with pictures\n\nCons: Haven't found anything yet\n\nI bought this after having the android bionic. Its an improvement in every way. The battery life is so much longer, it even charges really fast. I think the camera and photo features are awesome. The set up and program is super user friendly. I think its an awesome phone all the way around.", "Pros: all the features and how fast it works\n\nCons: needs a set of speakers in the front\n\nI went from an iPhone 5 to the galaxy and I love it cant wait for the next galaxy product", "Pros: Very responsive , quick, and fun to use\n\nCons: nothing comes to mind\n\nI have had this phone for a month now, really like it, I have had smart phones sense they came out, and really like this one very much, love the camera not only for the 13mp but all the extras that you can use.", "Pros: Everything\n\nCons: battery life\n\nI love it-but I had to buy an extended battery because I run lots of background stuff and my phone would die by the end of the day.", "Pros: I love the display and ease of use\n\nCons: A few settings aren't intuitive but this is a great phone\n\nThis phone is a huge upgrade from my old phone and It had been fantastic. I used it as my camera on a recent trip and the pictures were amazing as was the battery life. Great phone!", "Pros: 5 inch screen\n\nCons: Reading sd card\n\nThe phone is great except it keeps saying sd card not mounted or something like that. My card is in but yet it keeps giving me this issue. I think it's a Samsung defect because others on YouTube have the same issue. Other than sd card issue I LOVE THIS PHONE!!! I switched from an iPhone 4 to this.", "Pros: user friendly,strong hardware,big beautiful screen,SD card able,much more\n\nCons: none so far.\n\nI suffered from tiny,wimpy,restricted I-phone syndrome before but GS4 makes me satisfy every time I use the GS4. Big but not too big that fits any pockets. Very strong hardware. Easy to use. Screen is beautiful n big enough for anything. New added features are amazing. It has internal memory also able to use the SD cards of any size increase the capacity. I-phone?......good luck with that! I love my phone. Yeah!!!!", "Pros: easy to set up . great pictured quality.\n\nCons: camera gets stuck and cant take pictures right away\n\nI give 4 stars. It is easy to you comes in very handy I like the idea of the app automatically updating.", "Pros: everything, quality, clarity\n\nCons: battery is 1-10, i rate a 7\n\ngreat phone,\nthe battery could be better.\npictures and video are great,\nsound quality is awesome.", "Pros: Love the size and that it is 4G\n\nCons: Cannot see the screen so well in the sun.\n\nI love the size of the phone and streaming music and movies with it.\nI did not like that I had to get rid of my Unlimited data plan.", "Pros: Very easy to setup! Love the eye movement capture feature!\n\nCons: OK Battery life\n\nThis is a great phone with a great camera! I love the feature that captures your eye movement to scroll the screen!", "Pros: No problems\n\nCons: Battery and sound only average\n\nMy samsung Galaxy s4 is great! The features are great, but even better is that it has never crashed or frozen and it does everything I want it to do. Using two apps at the same time and many easy ways to share data make it easy to use. Good camera. If you don't use it a lot then the battery might last all day.", "Pros: screen size and different uses\n\nCons: can't delete one event on the calender when you have a series set\n\nl have been satisfied so far from having a iPhone previously.", "Pros: Pretty much everything. Haven't had any issues with it at all thus far\n\nCons: Nothing so far...\n\nI definitely recommend this phone. it pretty much has everything you need in a phone. I'm getting a lot of my friends who have iPhones changing their minds and going with this one. Awesome", "Pros: Not governed by Apple! I can do what I want.\n\nCons: Typical battery life........and way too many apps that are uninstallable.\n\nOne negative..........I wish you could delete some of the bloatware on this phone. It is not allowed. You can only delete apps that you have downloaded. I don't need 10% of the apps that were pre-loaded. Maybe they will update the software some day that would allow it........ Had it a month already. Uses very little data if you are around WiFi most of the time. What's not to love?", "Pros: So many thing to do with the features\n\nI love this phone. The android OS makes it the second best phone in the market. The Galaxy Note II is still number one.", "Pros: Easy to read screen\n\nCons: iOS 7 for iPhone is better all around\n\nBought this as a second phone. My primary phone is an iPhone5. This is a very solid phone, and has much better battery life than the GalaxyS3. I bought it before iOS7 was announced for the iPhone. Before iOS7, the Samsung is clearly the better choice, but after the changes in iOS7 (I have a Developer's copy on my iPhone 5), the iPhone is again, a clear leader.", "Pros: Best buy has a great shopping experience. camera is tops\n\nCons: Sprint, software bugs\n\nBest buy shopping was almost completely no hassle, dealing with sprint notso much. Phone has a beautiful camera with super sharp pics if you can hold the phone still. Screen is as sharp as any I have seen. Battery gets me a full day, or 4 pm if im using it constantly, less when in poor coverage locations. No lte in my area or wi max. Great call quality though. However the s features are not worth the effort.", "Pros: battery lasts all day, camera takes amazing photos with lots of editing options\n\nCons: camera blurs pictures of you're not holding the phone really still.\n\nLove the new technology! So much to do on the phone.", "Pros: Large, responsive display. Runs apps quickly and smoothly. Easy to use.\n\nCons: Comes loaded with apps you can't get rid of that take up way too much of your device storage.\n\nThis phone replaced my original Droid, so I guess you have to take my attitude towards it with a grain of salt. When compared to the brick that was my former companion, it is slim and svelte, quick, and generally capable of everything I can think of asking it to do. So far, I'm impressed and quite happy with my purchase.", "Pros: Very easy to setup! Love the eye movement capture feature!\n\nCons: OK Battery life\n\nThis is a great phone with a great camera! I love the feature that captures your eye movement to scroll the screen!", "Pros: No problems\n\nCons: Battery and sound only average\n\nMy samsung Galaxy s4 is great! The features are great, but even better is that it has never crashed or frozen and it does everything I want it to do. Using two apps at the same time and many easy ways to share data make it easy to use. Good camera. If you don't use it a lot then the battery might last all day.", "Pros: many features and fast\n\nCons: complicated at first, no manual\n\nThe Samsung galaxy S4 is a powerful phone with many features but no manual for one who likes to learn by reading it is difficult., the salespeople in most stores don't have it yet and aren't fluent in the features., Don't use the easy mode it makes it difficult to customize everything., even the zoom on the camera doesn't work in Easy, although it took an hour for the sales guy to figure it out.\nOnce you learn the phone it can do everything", "Pros: Cool new features, intuitive\n\nCons: Screen cracked the first time I dropped it\n\nI have had a IPhone, Droid Rzr, Casio, and the Galaxy S4. This phone blows them all away. It really does it all, and I felt like I've been using it for years as soon as I picked it up. I couldnt be happier with it.", "Pros: The processor, the screen, the camera\n\nCons: no users manual with the phone\n\nThe processor speed with the full HD screen is great for viewing movies, it takes great pictures with the 8mp camera and with the mobile hot spot you can use it to connect multiple devices on line from anywhere.", "Great Phone!! I have had the S2, S3 and now S4 and I'm SOOO glad I switched from my IPhone a few years ago! Now I have my Fiance using my S3 so she can get used to it!!", "Pros: Camera, screen size and resolution, Android\n\nCons: Nothing\n\nThis has been the best phone that I've ever owned.

Everything about this phone blows everything else out of the water in my opinion.", "Pros: Everything\n\nI was afraid to switch from iPhone 4S to my new galaxy s4, but I am very satisfied with my galaxy s4. It's an awesome phone, good video quality and picture.", "Pros: attery life, screen size, faster updates\n\nCons: still has connectivity problems in certain areas\n\n5 star unit for a cell phone but I don't understand why I have to add more text to my message", "Pros: Love the quality of pics + pic burst\n\nCons: download instructions not clear\n\nInstructions are too technical should be easier downloading off internet come on who wants to download over a hundred pages of instructions keep it simple so it's more accessible the battery runs down in about 12 hours not good. I was kinda disappointed in those aspects bought it for camera functions everytime I turn on the camera it takes a picture of something easy to delete but that is wasted time.", "Pros: It has alot of features other phones don't have.\n\nCons: Battery not great.\n\nIf you're looking for a new phone this is a great one.

Many other options to mention.", "Pros: battery life\n\nCons: keyboards punctuation marks are all over the place\n\nLove everything about it. Much better than iphone. Free apps, battery life is great, screen is large enough, camera quality and functions are amazing", "Pros: Everything\n\nCons: Nothing so far\n\nI LOVE this phone.

I recommend this phone for anyone.", "Pros: amazing camera, very fast processor\n\nCons: speaker is in the back of the phone\n\nSwitched from the iPhone 5 to the Galaxy S4.

I'm extremely pleased.", "Pros: Love the size, not heavy, good picture quality\n\nCons: Having trouble keeping linked to blue tooth in car\n\nI opted for Samsung over getting another HTC product and do not regret my choice. Love the size and weight of phone. It is easy to use and has lots of cool options. I am sure I will never use then all. The picture quality is as good as my digital camera and much easier to use. My only complaint is its connection or lack of to my car's blue tooth. While it recognizes it, the connection will drop periodically and during calls. This never happened with my HTC.", "I lived the AMOLED big screen and the Android capabilities and great features of this phone, but I swapped it out three times for pocket dialing and touch screen problems. The camera is okay when manually taking pictures and great when it auto focuses on faces but not great.", "Pros: amazing sales associate\n\nCons: nothing!\n\nour sales associate cyrus was amazing helped us on pricing was an all around great help! helped me find the phone I wanted as well as found phones for my whole family AND accessories. We got all brand new phones the expierence was long but worth it thanks to him! I LOVE SAMSUNG!", "Do you homework. MISLEADING ADVERT!!!!! This is not the correct description so i question this and you tell me its my fault for not making sure my network is capable. THE i9500 DOES NOT PERFORM AT 4G or LTE, check Samsung, check news articles.", "Pros: The screen, camera, removeable battery and sd card slot\n\nCons: Build material\n\nThe Galaxy S4 is a great upgrade if you're coming from an older Android or even from an iPhone. It's ridiculously fast and will last you at least the normal two years and probably more if you take care of your stuff.", "Pros: Easy to get a world on your hand\n\nThis is an excellent mobile for the smartphone users.

Gorilla Glass has held up well, no scratches.\n\nThe phone has solid functionality with no snags or glitches - except - an incompatibility with the music app DoubleTwist, which provoked a \"Unfortunately, Bluetooth share has stopped.\" error.

The specs of the S4 were just all around better than the HTC One. In addition to that, Samsung makes it much easier to run a custom ROM on your phone.

The screen is just the right size, beautiful to behold. It fits nicely in my pocket or holster. Gorilla Glass has held up well, no scratches.\n\nThe phone has solid functionality with no snags or glitches - except - an incompatibility with the music app DoubleTwist, which provoked a \"Unfortunately, Bluetooth share has stopped.\" error.

Thanks to the constant battling between Apple and nearly everybody else, the S4 does not have auto correct when typing text, emails, etc... on the US version of this phone.", "Pros: it does everything\n\nCons: speaker is not very good when playing music\n\nI absolutely love this phone. It does everything and is more of a computer than a phone. My only gripe is the sound quality of the speaker when playing music.", "Pros: Fast, High Tech Features\n\nCons: Might be a little advanced for basic phone users\n\nThis phone is an awesome Android OS phone.

If you're planning on getting this phone, have your screen protector and case ready before using it, it's a very slippery and lightweight phone. I listen to a lot of music so I loaded it with a 64gb sd card that cost me only 45$ and use Play music to store all my music. This phone can do a lot and more; Use both camera's at once like photo in photo, best camera out there. Unless you're asleep during the day and awake during the night, go get the Nokia Lumia 928. The air functionalities really benefit when your hands are dirty or wet. The UI is like liquid - the samsung swype keyboard is flawless. Amoled screen exaggerates all colors, but what's wrong with seeing something more beautiful than what your eyes see? The colors are bright, and they stand out. I am coming from a HTC Droid Incredible 2 and have always been with Android because of it's flexibility to define you as an individual. You're just a groupy if you get an iPhone.

I have had the galaxy 1,2 and my wife has the note as well as laptops and tvs all Samsung so we are huge Samsung fans. They have renewed my confidence in them yet again with a high quality phone that does everything they promised it would do and more! I love the video pause feature and the scroll by eyes feature I read on my phone a lot and this is surprisingly useful. The swype typing is great too, I email for work a lot and text a fair amount too and this is great! I love all of the voice control with this phone too, I can run Pandora or set reminders while driving without even looking at my phone. The battery life is much better then my s2 and still has ands 25% left after being used moderately to heavy from 7:30am to 11pm consistently.

I LOVE IT!!!", "Pros: Great features, New technology, Crystal clear screen\n\nCons: It may actually be smarter than me!\n\nI absolutely love this phone. I've been a loyal Android user for many years, but Samsung really hit a home run with this phone. The technology is amazing and I discover new features all the time. The screen is beautiful- perfect for pictures and videos. Although the size is slightly bigger than I'm used to, it still fits easily in my purse and most of my pockets. Love love love this phone!", "Pros: New features including voice commands to search, gorilla glass, big screen\n\nCons: nothing so far\n\nMy husband just upgraded to this phone and he loves it.

Very satisfied", "Pros: The best pictures in a phone.\n\nCons: There is some bug with it.\n\nThis is a great phone, don't get me wrong. It takes vivid and great pictures. The options for the camera are great and it takes great videos. There are many things this phone can do, but are we really going to use all of them? Some of the bugs are: it gets stock in some screens, for example, the texting screen gets stock on a tilted screen and when I try to tilted the screen, it wont move so I have to close the texting screen and reopen it. It will be easier if the keyboard has have to comma in the first screen and not make it look for it on a second screen. I notice with this phone that here in Orlando, FL I don't have 4G speed but my family does in Michigan. The volume in the incoming/outgoing calls is always low and I always have to turn it up. One thing that bugs me is that when I'm online or on facebook, I cannot touch a picture and save it to the phone, it does not allow me to do that, why? When on Driving Mode, it takes to long to recognize my commands. Other then that, I love the size, the feel of it, the touch screen, the picture, the different screen. Yes, I do like it more then my last phone which was an HTC Evo, but like I say, there is room for improvement.\n\u00ab collapse", "The S4 is just as great as expected.

The size is a bit big but still fits in my back pocket even with an otter case on it. The battery lasts a good while considering I listen to music for 8 hrs straight and get on Facebook and the internet often in that same 8 hrs. The camera has 4x zoom and you can edit the picture.

Great upgrade, able to swap in my 32 GB Mico SD card making transferring all my information very easy. Speed is great, phone quality is much better than HTC. If you are looking for an upgrade a great alternative for an IPhone. Bigger screen, and able to increase memory, and replace the battery. Not a fan of where the usb/charging port location. Should be on the side or the top of the phone. Cumbersome to use while charging. One wish would have been to have a built in pad charger into the unit.

My partner, who at first decided to not upgrade and stay with his iPhone, now recently told me he wanted to switch!\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: so many different things to do with it\n\nCons: battery life\n\nI love my new phone. The camera is awesome, picture quality and the student things you can do with the camera. I also love the photo album that came with this phone. Just a all around great phone except the battery life could be better.", "Pros: Takes you to places no other phone can.\n\nCons: Everything is great so far.\n\nI was thinking about the Iphone but saw this one and was overwhelmed with it at first sight.", "Pros: pictures screen quality\n\nCons: game feels cheap\n\nThis phone had a lot of features with great potential. Unfortunately this is round one. Hopefully they work out allot of the kinks. The picture quality is awesome and so is the video. The game of the phone is very light but feels like plastic. The back of the phone is so smooth that it slides right out of your hand. Other than that out is a great phone. It is really fast when it is hooked up to wifi.", "Pros: Fast reponse ,eye and touchless functions\n\nCons: I would prefer the call log to combine contacts calls, instead of listing them all.\n\nI am very happy with the phone. I am never disappointed with Samsung. Although I still need to learn more about all the things the phone can do. I would highly recommend it.", "Pros: Speed\n\nCons: no durable\n\nThe gs4 is amazing. I use it for everything from watching movies to downloading music. I moved from an iphone and I would definitely do it again.", "Pros: android has come a long way and only gets better\n\nCons: some of the features like hand gestures and eye movement dont work all that well\n\nGreat phone for the money with fun features to show off when bored", "Pros: The camera is very clear. The customizable applications and widgets beat the iPhone hands down.\n\nCons: Some of the advertised functions like the smart scroll doesn't quite live up to the hype but who really needs it anyway\n\nAwesome phone overall. Took me about a week to get used to it after being a long time iPhone user and I was concerned about transferring my music and contacts. Best buy was able to do it in the store. Having a back button comes in very handy. I have never seen a phone take such great photos. Love how easy it is to customize.", "Pros: Ease of use, camera, image quality, all the upgrades, good battery life, great speakers\n\nCons: Nothing\n\nMy husband bought this. He had had the\nS2, S3 and traded in the S3 for the S4 at Best Buy. He loved all the Galaxies that he has had but said this is hands down the best one. He uses it regularly for music, texting, gaming, web surfing, and pictures of our kids. He thinks the Note II is too big and that this S4 is perfect.\n\nWe got the s-view flip cover which is really a great addition for the sake of convenience.", "Pros: Easy to use, good quality, and good features\n\nCons: Doesn't work well with D-Link routers, so please be warned folks!\n\nGreat smart phone that most will be pleased with. Only issues is that it doesn't work well with D-Link routers, so please be warned folks! I ended up buying a Netgear router and it works just fine.", "The Samsung Galaxy S4 is the most hotly anticipated smartphone ever from the Korean brand, and with a glut of high end features, it's the most powerful and desirable device Samsung has created yet.\nOn top of that, there's a much faster processor packed under the hood, ample storage space for media thanks to an expandable memory card slot, and the likes of 4G LTE, Bluetooth 4.0, NFC and pretty much any other connection you care to mention on board.", "Pros: Large Screen, Camera Quality, Looks\n\nCons: Dings easier than my original Galaxy S\n\nI've had this phone since the first week they came out. It's been pretty awesome. I get about 2 days usage out of a single charge. Just turn off your location settings and turn on power saver mode and you're good to go. The camera quality is fantastic. The panorama and HDR come in very handy. 4G LTE speeds on Sprint hit 25-30mbps at my house where I have perfect reception. The samsung settings are confusing and frankly don't make ANY sense what-so-ever. I wish the \"settings\" menu had been left to native android.\n\nI dropped it in the parking lot from my pocket and it got a few good dings on the side casing. The screen is still in mint condition though. Just wish the case was stronger like the original Galaxy S.\n\nI don't regret purchasing this and glad I chose this over the HTC One.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: You can navigate the phone and change settings to your preference with ease.\n\nCons: Using the smart screen features is a technique. Not as easy as I had anticipated.\n\nI'm delighted that I chose the SGS4! I'm excited and still learning about all the features. I love the camera, the multi-window, and using the voice to control the volume when I'm listening to music! The SGS4 is by far the best phone on the market and I'm the envy of my kids who are stuck with their Iphones for now. I can customize my phone to use the features that suit my lifestyle and and change any of them in an instant! I'm just a happy camper all around with my SSG4!", "Pros: Everything, nuff said\n\nCons: It's an android device, do I really need to mention the battery again\n\nIf a new Galaxy device comes out and there are STILL new things to learn, then this is the device to have always. Great size, better battery, new cooler options, there are so many awesome things to say about an epic device. Have fun turning off other peoples televisions. Gotta love the advertising from Samsung. So much support and multiple accessories to play with", "Pros: Good battery life, Awesome Pictures!\n\nCons: sound when watching videos could be better\n\nLove the phone! I don't have many complaints about it beside the video sound being hard to hear if there is other noise in the room.\n\nIt is super light and thin. Awesome software and features! I would not trade it for another phone!", "Pros: Battery life is great\n\nCons: Speaker isn't very loud/clear\n\nI moved to the S4 from an HTC. Some things improved and others didn't. I like pretty much everything about the S4. Great picture, the battery is WAY better than my last phone.\n\nOnly downsides - alarm isn't as convenient as HTC. Speaker isn't very loud.\n\nOtherwise, I love this phone and I love seeing android and its supporters continue to innovate while Apple just releases the same thing over and over again.", "Pros: Large screen and awesome extras\n\nCons: It eats up data!\n\nLove it! Only downfall is that it goes through data like crazy! I've disabled everything and it still goes through it! I had to turn my data off!", "Pros: Great picture quality\n\nCons: battery life and I have problmes sending mms while on the phone.\n\nTHIS IS A GREAT PHONE!! It replaced my old android phone which would freeze all the time. I have yet to have any freezing problems with my S4.", "Pros: Beautiful Graphics and I love the Samsung App Store!\n\nCons: It's just too bulky\n\nI liked the phone itself but, unless you are someone who plays on their phone all-the-time, this may be a little overkill for you. It was for me. Also WAY too big for my hands. Beautiful graphics, cool features. If your phone is your life and you want to modify the heck out of it then this is the phone for you... just not for me.", "Pros: picture\n\nCons: quality\n\nI played my co-worker\u2019s new Galaxy S4, and it is sub-standard\nWe tried and played new S4 together for quite some time. The more we played, the more disadvantages we found. People around my partition all agreed he should have something better than this phone. Do not consider this Galaxy S4, it\u2019s just not good enough.", "Pros: nothing\n\nCons: lots of features are useless\n\nI still cannot believe the first time I held this S4 in my hand, \u201cIs this what Samsung use to compete with others?\u201d came straight into my mind. The look is same as old S3, the design is boring, lots of features are useless, the build is super budget-saving, the hand-feel is light but cheap, I just can\u2019t have a positive word on this toy (but it is not priced accordingly). I think any 3rd grade could figure out all the \u201clooking-good-but-useless\u201d features on S4. Sensible buyers should skip this one for sure.", "Pros: android, large screen\n\nCons: price\n\nGreat price so far, just a little upset how phone was 50 dollars more when I bought it than any other carrier and now they dropped it to 200. But great phone.", "Pros: Customizable User Interface, Google Account Sync, More Options\n\nCons: Glitchy Operating System\n\nI finally made the switch as a long time iPhone user to the Samsung Galaxy S4. While the S4 has GREAT features, its software is not solid; it's glitchy and somewhat slow straight out of the box. The S4 offers so many great widgets but enabling them can severely affect the battery life -- so choose widgets wisely!\n\nOne huge annoying thing about the S4 is the auto-correct feature, or lack thereof. Unlike the iPhone, where words are auto-replaced when incorrectly typed, the S4 only offers you suggestions for you to choose and change but does not auto-correct; this completely kills the flow of typing. While there is a third party app that addresses this issue (Jelly Bean Keyboard), you then lose the ability to 'swype'. Why Samsung got rid of this auto-replace feature in the S4 is anyone's guess.\n\nPersonally, I think while the S4 offers pretty unique features, a lot of them are pretty useless; eye-ball scrolling...really? You gotta see how silly you look trying to use it.\n\nPlease note that even though the phone says it comes with 16GB of space (assuming you got the 16GB version), only about 9.7GB is actually available to you because the operating system takes up more than 6GB. Download a few cool games on to your phone and BOOM, you'll be out of space. Sure, you can add a SD card as an external storage, but that would only be good for storing pictures and music as you can't download apps to it.\n\nThe size of the S4 is pretty big and difficult to control with one hand but the large screen is nice to have especially when watching videos.\n\nI would recommend the Galaxy S4 despite all its flaws because unlike the iPhone, I feel less restricted and am able to do so much more with the S4.\n\nI hope Samsung addresses many of the phone's bugs and glitches soon. Otherwise, 'The Next Big Thing' will be the iPhone's iOS7! LOL.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: love the features\n\nCons: would be nice if speaker was better\n\nEverything I own is Samsung.

Larger screen, and much less confusing to use.", "Pros: Screen, flexibility\n\nCons: Short battery life, flimsy case\n\nMy first one was bad out of the box, the second one has been pretty solid. The battery life is very short, even with disabling GPS/Bluetooth/etc. A lot of gadgets translates to a lot of power consumption. The battery is quite sub-par with respect to my old iPhone 4.", "Pros: it has everything you need to do on it\n\nCons: none\n\nI love the phone I can do everything on it, it is easy to use, the screen is big enough, it is very light to carry, the camera on it works great, I don't need another camera to carry.", "Pros: It takes great pictures and is easy to navigate\n\nCons: plastic case and sound is just OK\n\nOverall this is a very good phone I like the many features and it controls so many different apps it has good memory and works very fast.", "Pros: can load my videos, documents and music straight to my storage\n\nCons: Speaker phone sound quality could be improved\n\nOverall a very good cell phone and there is noting much I can ask for the type of usage I have (call, surf, music, documents). The only down side I see is for the low battery life, but I guess it is for most of the phones since cell phones have become part of normal life and so the cell phone companies should really think on providing long life batteries as an standrd option with their phones", "Pros: So Many Capabilites\n\nCons: Haven't Gotten to This Yet!\n\nGreat Phone, Upgrade from a Samsung Galazy III, and it has alot of upgrades. From the app's to the camera it is a great new version phone. Highly recommend!", "Pros: screen\n\nCons: innovation\n\nSamsung company should produce something more worth owning, rather than this S4.\nIf we look at phone companies around, they all inject certain degree of innovation into their every phone. But this is not the case of Galaxy S4, people did not say negative comments for no reason. Where is the innovation? What is the quality? Still implementing plastic trash?

It takes better pics than the iphone. When you send them tho it compresses them and they arent as nice. Im still adjusting to a different keyboard.", "Pros: Every feature you could ask for...\n\nCons: Need to shut off mobil data usage or it will eat your battery.\n\nEasy access to the Apps. Quick internet response. Really clear display.\nFirst time with an android. Finding it to my liking more and more each day.", "Pros: Easy to use, new intuitive features\n\nCons: Accessories are a little pricy\n\nI have had a number of smart phones from Blackberry to Windows Mobile, an iPhone 3G but Android devices won my heart with all the features they have and the new ones they keep adding. The Galaxy S4 is no exception to this, many of the features that Samsung packed into this device you cannot get anywhere else. For example where many phones would rotate the screen based on gyroscopic orientation, this phone will check the orientation of your eyes. So if you are laying down and the phone thinks it is sideways it will still stay upright if you are holding it as such. Also it has a voice assistant that requires only voice to activate. Just say \"Hey Galaxy\" followed by what you want in pure English, you don't need to practically learn a new language to know what to say to find what you want. When you do buy this phone, call your best friend first and tell them they have some competition for the title.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: high def screen, sensitive touchscreen, camera features, app speed\n\nCons: Android os and at&t apps take only leave you with 9 Gigs of internal space on 16 gig phone,\n\nLove this phone, but was disappointed to find out that all the pre-loaded junk takes up almost half the space of internal ,memory on the 16 GB phone.

I upgraded from the Samsung Epic 4G. I have not taken the time yet to figure out everything this phone is capable of, but the things i have always used daily (email, messengers, favorite apps) are functioning flawlessly. Only tiny issue i have noticed is that my previously week Sprint signal in my home has become worse with this phone, but everywhere else it's great.", "Pros: Intuitive, Awesome Screen, Air Gesture, SD card slot, S Health\n\nCons: Bloatware takes up too much space\n\nBad:\nThere is a lot of bloatware on this phone. There are a lot of google apps, most of which I don't use. (Various Play apps like Books, Magazines, Music etc.) Then, Samsung also added a couple apps that I don't use like the S translate. Finally AT&T put on a bunch of junk like their own navigator, music app, and a few others. You can't get rid of any of them. Luckily, you can hide the apps you don't use in the app drawer.\nAs a result of all this bloatware, out of the 16GB that the phone comes with you are only able to use about 40%.\nGood:\nThe screen is amazing. This phone is similar in size to my previous Galaxy Nexus, but the screen is much bigger and brighter. To me, the phone is the perfect size. It fits in my pocket and has a screen that I don't mind watching videos or reading websites on.\nThe air gestures are really awesome. I love being able to hover over emails in my email list to take a glance without opening them. I like that I can wave my hand over the screen when it is locked to get a snapshot of my messages and notifications. I also really like being able to wave my hand to scroll sites when I am eating lunch. One thing to note, these features don't work in gmail or chrome, only in the stock apps. I set up my gmail in the stock app just to use this feature.\nThe camera modes are pretty nice too. The one where you can take pictures and remove things that moved is really nice. I used it to take pictures of something that was across a busy street while traffic was moving. I was able to compile a clear shot. The panorama works really smoothly too.\nSHealth is a really nice app as well. There is a built in pedometer, thermometer, and humidity sensor as well as food/exercise trackers. They have really helped me keep to my fitness goals. And using the thermometer I was able to prove to my boss that the office was well above comfortable temperature a few times.\nThere is also an IR blaster in the phone, which basically lets you control home theater equipment with ...\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Easy Setup, Large beautiful screen, Removable battery, Super light and compact\n\nCons: Nothing yet!\n\nI upgraded from a Droid Razr Maxx (great phone) to this, and I must say I'm blown away by all the features Samsung put into this. I'm a smartphone junkie, and this is certainly the best one I've ever owned.The screen is large, crisp, and bright. The phone is lightweight and compact. The 13 MP camera is awesome. On top of the already awesome amount of personalization options put in android by default, Samsung puts it over the top by letting you truly make the phone yours down to a \"t\", which is big for me because I'm all about the little things that make a phone experience just right. The phone also saves you time with pre-installed flashlight and task killer widgets, to avoid the need for downloading them. The only con I've seen so far is the button placement on the sides: I find myself hitting volume up or down when I unlock/lock the screen, but I AM LEFT HANDED, so that probably explains it. Nothing major, just a slight disappointment I suppose. All in all, the phone's screen, battery life, plethora of features, and good-looking/good-feeling form factor make this one a can't miss. I was blown away when I switched to a Razr Maxx from an iPhone, and my astonishment at how good this phone is puts that to shame.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: The screen. The camera.\n\nCons: laggy.

I have a slim case for it and it fits in my pocket with no issues.\nI am disappointed in the lag. For the processor speed I expected faster performance. In the month or so I've owned this device I've performed 3 hard resets due to it \"freezing\".\nOverall im pleased with the phone.", "Pros: There are so many features.

With the increased resolution and OLED technology, pictures are rich in detail and photos pop with color. The cameras on this phone aren't bad either. The 13 megapixel camera is one of the best cameras on a smartphone and takes pictures with great detail, perfect for the 5\" screen. It also has an okay 2 megapixel camera for selfies(can't believe I used that word).\n\nAs for the negatives, the design can be either love or hate. It's hard to distinguish the S4 with last years S3 and this being a flagship phone it would have been nice to use some higher grade materials to give it a premium feel. The 5\" screen phone design may not be for everybody and can be hard to mange with one hand. Battery life could be bad at first. Trying to manage apps and features on the phone while maintaining good battery life could take a while. After a few charge cycles it could be good for a day. Also, storage could be very tight on the 16GB model so the 32GB is recommended is you're a heavy app user.\n\nAs for my first Android phone, the Galaxy S4 is a great Android device and being one of the more popular Android phones it will get support for years to come.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: picture\n\nCons: value for price,quality\n\nI agree with other reviewers, Galaxy S4 is an absolute penny-pincher!

The camera is awesome! The detail included in each photo is incredible. I would say this is the best smartphone camera I have ever used, but i cannot quiet give it that title due to it's low light performance. If you do in fact take most of your photos in the daylight like myself, I don't think you can go wrong.\n2. The screen. The 1080p screen in gorgeous, don't even try to look for a pixel because you can't see it with the human eye. The screen in excellent for video consumption such as YouTube or Netflix.\n3.The speed. This phone is blazing fast and can handle anything you throw at it, It runs games without a hiccup whatsoever. Yes the phone did in fact stutter a bit when I first received it, but that was quickly fixed by a software update by Samsung.\n4. Build quality. This may seem like a surprise to most but hear me out. I have in fact dropped this phone a few times, on carpet and on hardwood floor, and not a ding or scratch has been added to the phone. My HTC One has fallen out of my hands onto the hardwood and a little ding on the corner of the phone was added.\n\nI now have a few things I don't care for on my Galaxy S4.\n1. The gimmicky features. Yes they are cool to show off to your friends, but they get rather annoying when your reading a webpage on your phone and all the sudden the screen starts scrolling on you. The great thing is that these features can be turned off, so problem solved.\n2. The power button. Don't get me wrong I love the location of the power button, it's in the perfect spot for my thumb.

The only two options I am considering are the HTC One and the Samsung S4. I bought both and spent two weeks using each and can firmly say that the S4 is a great phone but the One is better in basically every aspect. Build quality, sound, screen, speed and software. I'm not going to turn this into a comparison review but I just wanted to note that there is a clear winner between the two.\n\nThe S4... During my time with the phone I did not use any of the new features and had everything disabled besides the usual wifi, gps, etc. and unfortunately this phone still lagged... noticeably &amp; frequently. I had the phone when the first little update was released and the lag was still present. With a quad-core processor, there should be no lag whatsoever and I personally feel like the new features are slowing the phone down even when disabled.\n\nThe camera is awesome but there is a shutter delay that while not unbearable, was still annoying. Pictures are crystal clear and if you need to take pictures in the dark, turn on the flash. I don't understand what the big deal is when we begged for manufacturers to put flashes on smartphones and now that they have them, we don't want to use them?!?!\n\nTouchWiz is like smartphone software for a 12 year old.

I stopped at the 3G and was waiting for something to blow me away. None of the subsequent IPhones did it for me and the droid phones were looking better and better.\n\nCuriously the thing the tipped me over to droid was a pre-review of the Galaxy S4 that said it was the best phone out (yes the review did have some quibbles - you aluminum case folks you) But the review stated that the next IPhone (5S?) is not likely to impress and the IPhone 6 is probably 12- to 18 months out. So it gave the self-serving argument to go out and get the best phone out right now and just wait for the new iPhone in 2 years. That idea resonated with me and off I went to get a new phone.\n\nSuch an experience. I actually had to learn new stuff to operate this thing. No way android is as intuitive an interface as IOS but there was just so much to the phone that blew me away. I love the size, I love the extra memory available. I love the images.

Yes some of us folks still use the cell to actually talk to people.\n\nRight now I am finding apps to take advantage of some of my apple stuff.

Air Gesture)\n\nWhen I first got the phone, I was excited. After messing with the phone for a week or so, I found a few flaws that the phone has.\nCamera:\nFirst of all, the camera features that they implemented does not work; such as the feature which cuts out the people who the user does not want them in the picture. Also, it tends to lock up in camera mode when using some other features of the camera, and all you can do, like I said, stuck in camera mode unless you restart the phone.\nBattery Life:\nDecent battery size but would be great if the life would be longer, especially for people who plays games with their phone.\nCall Quality:\nIt was quite weird when talking on the phone with the noise reduction on. When used, sometimes the other person could not hear you due to the cut off or static. Then when shut off, It hears perfectly fine. Speaker was nice but sometimes end up doing the same. It may be the call between the two people but, bother people are at&t users.\nNew features the S4 has:\nThe air gestures, to air view, to smart scroll, and other new features the S3 did not have, does not work well. Sometimes it works, but most times it does not. It is pointless most of the time and tbh, I don't even use these features because it does not work for me at all. Either I be doing something wrong, but if slowly gesturing your hands and looking at the screen does not make it work then what am I doing wrong? And to keep in mind, needs to be in a bright area for the features to work well. Multi-view can get annoying at times because it pops up on the side. It does not let you edit things to be put in, but only default programs it has on the side already given. All you can do is just edit them out.

So my review will contrast the S4 with the HTC One. When I got home, the HTC seemed right in about every way. Build quality in a premium priced device is always a top priority for me, which is why I chose it over the S4. I was fortunate to not have any dead pixels and the boom speakers should be a set standard for phones; they sound great. Samsung was one of the first to have forward facing speakers in a tablet. They should have carried this over into their phones. However, after learning more about the two phones, I realized I had purchased the wrong phone. So I returned the HTC One for the Samsung Galaxy S4. Read along to see why.\n\nBuild Quality:\nThe build quality of the S4 feels great and sturdy in the hand. It is slimmer than the One, has a larger screen and weighs less. While it doesn't have as much of the premium fit and finish feel as the HTC One, it is just as sturdy. One large disappoint I had with the HTC One was that I realized it had not come with the 3rd generation of Gorilla Glass after purchasing it. My fault. HTC chose to use Gorilla Glass 2. Gorilla Glass 3rd Gen is 3x's less likely to scratch. Also, after watching some drop tests, I found that the poly-carbonate body (white color) of the S4 holds up better cosmetically when scratched or dropped. I am OCD at times and I don't tolerate scratches and scuffs well. So, if this does happen, the worst case scenario is that I can replace the back cover of the S4. The front of the phone is completely covered in 3rd Gen Gorilla Glass. This is one of the reasons why I believe the S4 does not have front facing speakers. Samsung choose to cover the entire front with glass and speaker grills would interfere with this design choice. One other thing that I found very disturbing about the HTC One is that the front speaker grills are lightly glued on. In some of the drop tests I observed (youtube), they easily popped off and would not press ba ...\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Speed, Screen resolution, removal battery, battery life, thin, big screen but same size form factor as gs3\n\nCons: nothing\n\nDo not listen to the bad reviews about this phone, those people must not know a good phone when they see one.

A case is going on regardless so the only preference is weight. Anyway, great phone samsung I'll use it till the battery fails. Then, I'll switch out the battery and keep going.", "Pros: Screen, Customization, Features, Camera\n\nCons: Apps can ONLY be installed onto the 16GB memory even with microsd cards!, Bloatware, Battery life\n\nI'm an iPhone user since the second generation, got tired of having to jailbreak the phone to use the customization all the android phones get natively.\n\nLots of features and built in apps. The screen is incredible, but dim by comparison to nearly all upper level smart phones and was hard to read in sunlight. Camera was great and does a very good job with pictures and could easily replace ever needing to carry one at 13mp. The ability to add removable memory and change batteries are on the top of the nice features list.\n\nIf you do not game much then this phone will suit most people since your music and photos could easily be put on the removable microSD card but when newer games come in at 1.5gb a piece it does not take much to run out of space on this. I found the battery to drain VERY fast when I kept the screen brightness to a level I liked. Coming from iPhones the build quality on this is marginal at best being all plastic, since most phones live their lives inside cases anyway this may be a moot point.\n\nAfter playing with a friends HTC One I think I am returning this and going with that phone. This is an incredible phone however and was enough to make an iEverything user switch their phone. If the 32GB or 64GB version were released at the same time and I could get them I would stay with this for sure.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Battery life, the screen, fits better in my hand than the S3\n\nCons: Android is some times quirky to get running perfect.\n\nI'm coming from a Galaxy S2, Galaxy Nexus, Galaxy S3, and now currently own the S4.\n\nThe S4 is the by far the best phone to date. I'll admit that it isn't a mind blowing huge update from the S3, but there are definite improvements.\n\nThe screen has just fantastic clarity, and overall the phone fits much better in my hand than the S3. Battery life is far superior to the S3 and previous phones. I really appreciate the fact that I can make it through 15 hour day, use 4 hours of on-screen time, and still manage to have 30% remaining. Never have I gotten such great battery life out of an Android device. I dont use many of the new samsung software features, however some people might. Most will find the new software features gimmicky.\n\nExpandable storage is another great feature and one that I look for in all of my phones. One can use up to a 64GB microSD card to store music and pictures or whatever else. Another consideration one should look at before purchasing this device that is 16 or 32 GB of memory is required for app storage. Apps are unable to be stored on the microSD card, and the Android operating system and Samsung software eat up a considerable amount of the base 16 or 32GB phone models.\n\nThe camera on the S4 is fantastic. I am just floored sometimes at the level of detain in my pictures. Images come out looking just fantastic, and this camera also takes some of the best low light pictures I have seen.\n\nI added a Ringke SLIM case for a minimal protection and look. Overall I am very pleased with the S4 and happy that I upgraded from the S3.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Easy to use, best screen quality, and awesome camera features\n\nCons: nothing\n\nSome people don't like the plastic, but I actually prefer the plastic (poly-carbonate) it's more durable than glass and resists better against scratches and chipped parts compared to the iphone 5 and HTC One. The camera is also better than the Iphone 5 and HTC One cameras in most shots (minus night and low light shots) But that's where the Flash shines on the Galaxy S4 for those situations. The Touchwix UI is easy to navigate and looks cleaner and simpler to use than the likes of the HTC One where Sense 5 seems a little cluttered and confusing to move apps, widgets and other things around. I love how Samsung changed the Camera interface, it looks really professional and easy to use. Samsung has added a lot of neat features to the phone such Air View, Smart Pause, and cool sci-fi like eye tracking technology. I use it every day, I was on lunch eating my food and my hands were sticky but I controlled the web browsing switching between tabs, scrolling up and down all without touching the screen. Love the innovation Samsung has brought to the Galaxy S4, You will see lots of reviews of people probably disliking it and raving about the HTC One or Iphone 5. Yet we all know that there is a reason why Samsung is now the number one phone manufacturer in the world; they listen to their customers, they give us what we ask for, and they continue to bring us the latest updates and features that other manufacturers don't.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: shape\n\nCons: looks cheap\n\nI got a S4 three days ago, because I saw so many commercials on S4 day-in and day-out (yes, I was bombarded!). I truly regret my purchase. This S4 looks cheap (cheap-looking indeed, but not cheap-to-buy) and feels cheap, I totally agree with other BestBuy reviews and comments. Almost all the experts and everyday users give a \u201cDon\u2019t buy\u201d response to S4, I now believe them 100%.\nI am an average user, and I love to receive the best quality phone I am paying for. Galaxy S4 is definitely NOT the phone! I am returning this S4, to the much better HTC One. HTC One has Premium design, look, feel, top-quality production, and all the real meat and bone for what I paid \u2013 this is exactly how I feel after I\u2019ve done my exchange.\nDon\u2019t just listen to the store salesperson\u2019s suggestion \u2013 they may have a different interest from yours.\n\u00ab collapse", "I've owned 3 smart phones and this one is the best one yet. iPhone 5 sucks in my opinion, I owned the original EVO & EVO 3d so I decided to go a different route other than HTC. You can't go wrong because of all the features. After 10 days I have no complaints, I don't think I'll have any in the foreseeable future.", "Pros: Camera and associated features.\n\nCons: Voice to text.\n\nI had a Samsung Infuse for two years. I loved it until my camera recently stopped working. I almost got the S3 until I learned that that the S4 had a 13 mp camera with a 2 mp front facing camera. The clarity is awesome. It has many different modes to select from such as the advertised crop a photobomber out of your picture.(It's a mode. You can't edit it in a normal mode) You can record from both camera and also snap pictures while recording from both cameras.\nThe scroll with your eyes feature isn't quite bug free. I like the tilt to scroll feature personally.\nThe biggest complaint I have is the voice to text. My Infuse was flawless in regards to this feature and I expected nothing less in any newer Samsung phone. However, I am very displeased with the lag time and lack of accurate translation of this phone.\n\u00ab collapse", "I was pondering whether to get this or the HTC One. I am very happy that I chose this device. First off I really don't understand why so many are hung up on build quality. Since when is aluminum a premium material? Where was I when this happened? All I can say is for those who do prefer the feel of the aluminum build of the HTC One put a case on it because when it scratches (and it will) the so called premium build doesn't seem so premium after all. In terms of performance these two devices were neck and neck for me. On of the first things that got me hooked was the screen. Its big, bright, crisp, and colorful. Another thing that helped me sway my decision was the 13 megapixel shooter on this thing. The features and options are too many to list really but all I can say is that the Samsung Galaxy s4 is the phone to beat this year.\n\u00ab collapse", "I'm not sure how so many apple fanboys got through to review this phone before me. Let me set the record straight the gs4 is an amazing phone and feels really great in your hands, the screen is beautifully crisp and I've had no problems seeing it outside. As for the plastic build quality it's either something you love or hate, I personally love it because its light, cheaper to repair, and not as easily damaged like the metal on the iPhone and htc one. Once you drop one of those phones your left with permanent damage. Back to the s4 the battery has been great I've had no problem making it through the day and I'm a heavy user, as for all the new features you will either use them or you won't but they can be easily turned off or disable. I strongly recommend a sd card cause there is only about 9.5gb for installing apps. The 13mp camera is awesome and the new camera modes are fun to use. All in all if you loved the the gs3 or the note 2 then you will love the gs4 don't be fooled by obvious apple fans giving reviews\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: everything air view is awesome\n\nCons: battery still not the best better than s3\n\ngood size phone samsung always innovating this phone is by far the best better than htc one...in all aspect...i love the latest jellybean update....plus the resolution on the 13mp camera is awesome if you want the best phone in the market the search is over go and get this phone.you won't be let down by samsung....", "Pros: Screen, processor, and everything else\n\nCons: Nothing\n\nThe S4 will decimate all other phones in every aspect. Great screen, good battery life, very responsive and no lag whatsoever. Videos and movies in HD look great on the AMOLED screen. True blacks and colors are vivid. Nothing bad about it, but if you find it in store get it cuz they are gonna sell fast.", "Pros: Nice Software\n\nCons: No upgrade looks speakers are garbage\n\nI purchased the phone Friday and took it back the next day it is not as responsive as it should be. It has a cheap look and feel there is only a slight between it in the S3 the speaker is garbage. I took it back for a Brand new HTC ONE which is a more Sexy phone the one drawback that everyone complains about is the lack of expandable memory The Galaxy S3 Comes wit only 16Gb of memory expandable to 64GB The HTC ONE comes with 32 or 64 which is more than enough for a phone.", "Pros: 4G\n\nCons: Everything\n\nbad battery life and cheap case. i use iphone 5 after using gs4 and iphone is faster and easy. the gs 4 like other android phones has many viruses and it will break the phone. do youreself a favor and buy a quality phone like apple. it is soooo much faster and feels like unlike the gs 4. the gs4 lags a lot crashes everyday and freezes almost all the time.. DO NOT BUY", "Pros: 1080 screen, color accuracy, battery life\n\nCons: Some software features, Storage\n\nGreat smartphone so far. Ive had it for about 3 days now and im loving it. The large 1080 5 inch screen is the perfect size and the quality is amazing. They've managed to produce very accurate colors while still retaining those dark blacks. The movie mode is best for color accuracy. If you want the more saturated look then stick with dynamic mode. Battery is also really good, it can easily last me the entire day without having to charge it. I dont use all the gimmicky software features with smart scroll or air view because they kill battery and they don't work too well half the time but that doesnt bother me too much. Also the storage is a little lacking (you're only getting about half of the 16gb) so i would definitely recommend getting a microsd card.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: Cool Features\n\nCons: Cheaply made and laggy\n\nI changed from an iPhone 5 to a Samsung Galaxy S4. It is not what I expected. While it does have some new cool features and takes good pictures, the phone itself is a cheap plastic and just feels cheap in your hand. Also when texting, typing on the internet, scrolling, and especially when watching youtube videos, it lags. When you rotate the screen, it is significantly slower to respond than an iPhone. I am locked into a 2 year contract and hope that it grows on me. If the Apple iPhone 6, whenever it comes out, has anything new to offer, it will def blow this phone out the water and I will be kicking myself for not waiting. The quality is just not there.", "Pros: Everything\n\nCons: Nothing so far\n\nI'm upgrading from the AT&T galaxy s2 and its well worth the upgrade with the addition of the fast LTE nice display and great software features its all around great phone. I was stuck between this and the HTC One and decided to stick with the galaxy line though I wish the build quality was better the features and software make it worth getting this phone.", "Pros: Everything.\n\nCons: --\n\nI ordered the phone about 2 weeks ago and Sprint \"overnighted\" the phone the day they said they would. I have never bought or used a better phone. I had an iPhone 4s and this is a MAJOR upgrade. The speed, the dual screen, quality and durability of the phone stomp over all others. Above all, I am most impressed with the customization abilities and the beautiful screen it provides. The ability to run two apps at once is also a great plus. If anyone chooses another phone over this one will soon regret it!", "Pros: HD Screen, Cell Signal\n\nCons: Screen Outside, Layers of Options\n\nFinally picked up the S4 today from BB Mobile. Upgraded from the S3 (also have a Note2 on a scond line).\n\nThe S4 as stated in tons of online so-called \"expert reviews\" is identical to the S3 except minor changes to the size. My hope was the screen would be more readable outside since my S3 is pathetic. Unfortunately, Samsung has not improved the S4 in my view and if anything it's a bit dimmer (max bright, no power saving, no smart stay etc). Kind of a bummer Samsung.\n\nThe phone does seem to bring in cell signals better than my S3 since I'm on AT&T and always suffering from signal issues. After a day of use, I'd also say the battery is draining faster than my S3. Maybe this will improve a bit over a few days of use and full re charge cycles.\n\nOne change I really dislike on the S4 is the dialer has been changed from the awesome Samsung black to an all white dialer which can't be changed in Settings. I dislike it because at night in a crowded room it's like a searchlight. Guess I can install a 3rd party dialer but darn, that was always a Samsung UI feature I really liked.\n\nThe Settings menus have been expanded even more on the S4! It's nuts how many options there are, and more annoying to remember where you found it last time!\n\nLastly, this might be unimportant to most, but now Samsung has removed the SAR Rating for the S4 from the enclosed book and instead directed to a website! Really??\n\nRadiation levels matter on these things, and I think it's sneaky to no longer post the SAR in the box.\n\nOverall, not worth the $270 bucks. The S3 is really just as good in my view.\n\u00ab collapse", "Pros: easy to use, vibrant colors, fast, and efficient\n\nCons: none\n\nThis is the best phone that I have purchased in my life. It has all the features a person could ever want. It easy to navigate. It is easy to use. It is fast. When I watch a movie on the phone, I feel like I am watching it on my HD flat screen. This phone blows the Iphone out of the water. I like the fact that the time and weather is displayed on the front screen. The price of the phone was outstanding. I am going to have alot of fun using this phone.", "Pros: everything air view is awesome\n\nCons: battery still not the best better than s3\n\ngood size phone samsung always innovating this phone is by far the best better than htc one...in all aspect...i love the latest jellybean update....plus the resolution on the 13mp camera is awesome if you want the best phone in the market the search is over go and get this phone.you won't be let down by samsung....", "Pros: Screen, processor, and everything else\n\nCons: Nothing\n\nThe S4 will decimate all other phones in every aspect.

No other phone has this type of features. I just got my S4 today and I am loving it. Few people would have known that S4 was supposed to release in February but Samsung's CEO didn't liked the Back Cover of S4 so they throw out about 500,000 back covers and that's why S4 released in the end of April instead of February. That's why I Love Samsung and Thank You Samsung for this Amazing Gift.", "Pros: Android 4.2, 13mp camera, Air view, 1080p screen, weight, look & feel\n\nCons: N/A\n\nGot this device and can't put it down. I am an avid smartphone user and get almost everything that comes out. Had the GS3 left that for the Note 2 (currently also own an iPhone 5).\n\nAt first I thought I was going to miss the 5.5\" screen of the Note 2, but after using my S4 I am adjusting very quickly, due to most of the features included and the screen quality.\n\nAir View is great, being able to \"peek\" at info without touching your device.\nAir Gesture is another useful feature as if your reading an article and eating, you can move the page with a flick of the hand (or finger). Even better when driving, because you can wave the screen to answer the call.\n\nThe camera, while megapixels aren't always everything, this phone definitely beats the Note II and GS3. I have been looking for a great android phone camera to rival my iPhone 5 and I think I have found it. The new features, Drama mode to stitch pixs together, as well as dual camera to put urself in a picture are EXCELLENT. The ability to do sound and shot also is another plus.\n\nThe overall look (even thou not premium compared to the HTC ONE) is definitely a step in the right direction as its not a plain black or white. The subtle aluminum bezel makes a nice addition.\n\nThe new features as part of Android 4.2, such as customizing ur notification shade quick settings and putting personalized text on ur lockscreen, in addition to the much welcomed, music player widget on the lockscreen. FANTASTIC!!\n\nBattery Life, so far I am averaging about 14-16 hours on med-heavy use which is acceptable for the screen size/quality.\n\nOverall very satisfied with my purchase at full price, really contemplated over the last week with getting the HTC ONE, but it's the little things that matter sometimes; a feature having it, just in case one day you decide to use it. Battery percentage in status bar, quick settings in notifications, traditional app drawer are all to be appreciated.
